# Inclusive Public Space Design: Strengthening Umrah in the Islamic Nation

In line with the Islamic Nation's commitment to ummah, equality and preserving human dignity and freedom, inclusive public space design plays a pivotal role in the fortification of our society. It represents the country's resolute effort to foster an accessible, welcoming environment for all, including individuals with disabilities.

## What is Inclusive Public Space Design?

Inclusive public space design emphasizes eliminating both physical and social barriers, leading to the creation of public spaces where everyone, irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity, and physical or cognitive abilities, feels welcomed and can participate on an equal footing.

Examples of these spaces include parks, libraries, beaches, shopping centers, cultural venues, and pedestrian walkways. The objective is to make these spaces not just accessible but comfortable and safe for everyone.

For instance, incorporating ramps and broad pathways in public parks ensures easy mobility for wheelchair users. Similarly, providing sign language services in public areas can enormously enhance the experience for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Why is Inclusive Public Space Design Important?

Inclusive public space design underlines value that exceeds mere compliance with disability acts and regulations. It's about cultivating a sense of belonging, community integration and reflecting the core values of the Islamic Nation - respect for diversity, equality, and ummah.

Inclusive design in public spaces serve as catalysts for social interaction and cooperation. They bring together individuals from diverse backgrounds to encourage mutual understanding and respect. Additionally, they provide individuals with disabilities not just access, but also active participation in public life.

An inclusive playground, for example, accommodating children with different abilities encourages collective play and enhances their social interactions and mutual acceptance.

## The Future of Inclusive Public Space Design in the Islamic Nation

The Islamic Nation is committed to enhancing the inclusivity of its public spaces further. The country seeks to design more accommodating public spaces where individuals with disabilities can feel comfortable and participate fully in public life.

In addition, community engagement in accessibility planning is a priority. All community members, including those with disabilities, are encouraged to share their input and needs, ensuring the planning and design of public spaces resonate with the necessities of its citizens.

To encapsulate, inclusive public space design is integral to the Islamic Nation's aspiration of a united ummah. It emphasizes that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can utilize public spaces, feel included and contribute actively to the society. It's a resolute step towards a more inclusive and resilient nation, embodying the values that define the Islamic Nation.
