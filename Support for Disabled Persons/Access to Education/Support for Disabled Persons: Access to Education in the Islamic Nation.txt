# Support for Disabled Persons: Access to Education in the Islamic Nation

The Islamic Ummah values *equality* and *human dignity* in all its forms, with a special focus on ensuring that persons with disabilities are not denied their right to quality education. Fundamental to this pledge is the regular evaluation and advancement of educational policies.

## Access to Education

Education is a divine right bestowed upon every child, and children with disabilities are no exception. The Islamic Nation is committed to ensuring that the disabled have equal access to education as their non-disabled peers. For instance, the Ministry of Education has rolled out *Special Education Programs* and provides *Scholarship Opportunities* to enhance higher education among disabled students.

## Inclusive Education Policies

Recognising that every child is unique in how they learn, the education system within our Islamic Nation has embraced *Inclusive Education Policies*. This means educational institutions cater to the diverse learning needs of every student, including balancing between mainstream classes and special education classes. The approach includes providing *Adequate Training for Teachers* to equip them with the knowledge and skills to address the varying needs of their students and the integration of *Assistive Technology in Education* to further bridge the learning gap.

## Collaboration with Parents and Carers

Involving parents and carers in the learning process is essential. The Islamic Nation acknowledges this by promoting *Collaboration with Parents and Carers*. Parents and carers are regularly updated about their child's progress and are involved in critical decisions concerning their child's education.

## Defense of Disabled Students' Rights in Education

Access to education doesn't just manifest in physical accessibility. The Islamic Ummah is committed to ensuring that disabled students are accorded their rights and are protected under the law. It has structures in place to ensure the *Rights and Legal Protection of Disabled Students in Education* and is committed to the *Creation of a Safe and Acceptable Educational Environment* for disabled students, shielding them from any form of discrimination or bullying.

## Regular Evaluation and Improvement of Educational Policies

The Islamic Nation recognises that constant efforts must be maintained to enhance disabled persons' access to education. Regular evaluation allows the identification of areas needing improvement. Routine updates and modifications of educational policies exhibit our unwavering commitment to providing a robust learning environment for all.

In conclusion, our Islamic Nation, through careful implementation and scrutiny of its policies, actively seeks to provide an inclusive, accessible, and conducive educational environment for persons with disabilities. This falls within the broader framework that cherishes diversity, upholds human dignity, and champions equality for all its citizens under the Ummah.
