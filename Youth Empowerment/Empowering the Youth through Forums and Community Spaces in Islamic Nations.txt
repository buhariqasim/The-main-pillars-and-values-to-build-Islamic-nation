# Empowering the Youth through Forums and Community Spaces in Islamic Nations 

The principles and values of nation-building within Islamic Nations emphasise the essential role of youth empowerment. A significant approach to this empowerment is the establishment of Youth Forums and Community Spaces. These platforms hold a key role in allowing the next generation to articulate their ideas, cooperate on innovative concepts, and actively engage in community-building activities.

#### **Nature and Scope of Youth Forums and Community Spaces**

In Islamic Nations, Youth Forums and Community Spaces take on various forms, which include community centres as well as clubs and online platforms. They aim to promote interaction, dialogue, and active participation amongst the youth. Activities in these platforms are usually connected with educational programs, health and well-being initiatives, and civic participation projects.

#### **Promoting Dialogue and Active Citizenry**

These platforms provide a stage for the youth to express their viewpoints, learn from each other, and engage in democratic processes. For example, a youth forum in Jakarta, Indonesia, allows for free interactions between young individuals and decision-makers, discussing a wide array of societal issues, such as youth welfare and environmental concerns. This gives young adults an opportunity to help shape the trajectories of their communities.

#### **Fostering Social Inclusion and Community Building**

Community spaces, on the other hand, prioritise social inclusion. These centers provide activities like sports, arts, and cultural programs, which unify youths from diverse backgrounds. A community center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for instance, offers regular football games, allowing interaction amongst teens from various backgrounds, thus promoting unity and harmony.

#### **Instigating Innovation**

Youth Forums and Community Spaces in Islamic Nations are not only platforms for conversations and physical activities. Innovation hubs in these nations encourage young entrepreneurs to brainstorm, share ideas and start projects. An illustrative example is the Wamda Space in Dubai, UAE, which caters primarily to tech-inclined youth, fostering their enterprising spirit.

#### **The Road Ahead**

As technological advancements continue to transform the landscape, digital youth forums and community platforms are becoming increasingly significant. These forums can reach more people and provide more opportunities for the youth of Islamic Nations to participate and contribute, no matter their geographical location.

Certainly, Youth Forums and Community Spaces in Islamic Nations serve as a critical facilitator for social change, reflecting the values of the Islamic Ummah that include Democracy, Equality, and Community Solidarity. 

As strategists in Islamic nations, we consistently encourage young people's active participation through these platforms, acknowledging the critical part they play in sustaining and enhancing the Islamic Ummah's future.
