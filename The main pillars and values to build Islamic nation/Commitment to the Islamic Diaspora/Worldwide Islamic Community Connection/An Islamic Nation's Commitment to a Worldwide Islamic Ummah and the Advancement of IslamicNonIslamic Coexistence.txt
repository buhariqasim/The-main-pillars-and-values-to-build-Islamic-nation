# An Islamic Nation's Commitment to a Worldwide Islamic Ummah and the Advancement of Islamic-Non-Islamic Coexistence

Building a nation is a global initiative that requires collective efforts from all stakeholders. An Islamic Nation is constructed around vital pillars and values that demarcate its existence and its constant pursuit of progress and prosperity. Two essential elements of the Islamic nation's roadmap for nation-building are its unshakeable commitment to the Worldwide Islamic Ummah and the advancement of Islamic-Non-Islamic coexistence.

## Worldwide Islamic Ummah
This commitment is embodied in the recognition and respect for the diverse heritage of the Islamic diaspora and the nurturing of ties amongst Muslims globally. It sparks and sustains the bond between the Islamic nation and Muslim communities worldwide, encourages unity, and promotes shared experiences and exchanges for mutual enrichment.

For instance, the Islamic nation promotes Arabic language and its unique culture in Islamic schools across the globe, ensuring that children of the Ummah mature with a profound understanding of their heritage. We also encourage Islamic migration and extend ample support to those making Hijrah, contributing to a stronger, more diverse Islamic nation.

Numerous initiatives commemorate significant historical Islamic events, preserving the memories and lessons from our shared past. Such initiatives ensure future generations are aware of their history and the resilience of their ancestors, further strengthening their bond to the Islamic nation.

The preservation of Islamic history and heritage is deemed critical in an Islamic nation. Heritage here includes religious symbols, unique architecture, and significant archeological sites, in addition to historical events. Consequently, the promotion of tourism to these heritage sites among the worldwide Islamic community is given a high priority.

## Advancement of Islamic-Non-Islamic Coexistence

An Islamic nation is a diverse nation with various non-Islamic minorities. The advancement of Islamic-Non-Islamic coexistence is an essential pillar to guarantee peace, harmony, a shared society, and mutual respect within the country. The Islamic nation actively encourages initiatives that foster dialogue, understanding, and respect between Islamic and non-Islamic citizens.

Social activities and educational programs that bring Islamic and non-Islamic together help break stereotypes. These platforms allow these individuals to share and learn from each other's cultures and traditions, fostering a better mutual understanding.

Moreover, policies of equality and fair laws are central to coexistence. A shared understanding of democracy, respect for the rule of law, and ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their racial, ethnic or religious identity, enjoy their full rights and protections  are pivotal to boosting coexistence.

The Islamic Nation nurtures partnerships with non-Islamic and Islamic organizations oriented towards peaceful coexistence, appreciating their significance in bridging divides and stimulating dialogue.

These twin commitments aren't merely principles but form the DNA of our core ethos. They tie us back to our shared history, connect us across continents, and inspire us to create a nation built on peace, unity, and shared prosperity. As we strive towards these aims, we build a stronger, more inclusive Islamic nation, united by the spirit of togetherness and peace.
