# The Main Pillars and Values to Build Islamic Nation: Encouraging Youth Involvement and Supporting Islamic Art and Culture

Building the Islamic nation is rooted not only in the principles surrounding the Islamic Ummah and democracy but also in the commitment to developing and preserving the Islamic diaspora. Two major components in this commitment are the promotion of youth involvement and the support for Islamic art and culture.

## Encouraging Youth Involvement

Youth involvement is essential to the continuity and growth of any nation or group, and the Islamic population is no exception. Encouragement of youth involvement is vital for building an Islamic nation. It helps foster a strong sense of Islamic identity among the young generation and prepares them to become future leaders, advocates, and ambassadors of the Islamic community.

The efforts to encourage youth involvement are broad and varied. They range from initiatives to foster community events such as holiday celebrations, fundraising programs, and social gatherings that enhance unity and fellowship within the Islamic community. Moreover, promoting trips to important Islamic historical and religious sites can offer the youth a first-hand experience of Islamic heritage and enable them to gain a deeper understanding of their identity.

Furthermore, nurturing leadership qualities in youths is another significant aspect. This can be achieved through various leadership training programs and platforms, enhancing the youth's capabilities to take on key roles in the community and vocalize the rights, values, and aspirations of the Islamic community worldwide.

## Supporting Islamic Art and Culture

Islamic art and culture play an indispensable role in preserving Islamic heritage and identity; therefore, supporting them is a critical pillar in building an Islamic nation. They are the means through which Islamic tradition, history, and essence can be passed on from generation to generation. 

From music, painting, calligraphy to literature, dance, and playwriting, Islamic art and culture manifest in numerous forms, each encapsulating aspects of Islamic life, spirituality, challenges, and victories. By supporting Islamic art and culture, an understanding, respect, and pride for Islamic identity can be instilled in people's hearts, both within and outside the Islamic community.

For instance, supporting Islamic artists and cultural initiatives can be accomplished through scholarships for artistic studies, grants for art projects, or exhibitions of Islamic art. Furthermore, promoting cultural exchange of Islamic traditions and practices can contribute to the richness and diversity of global culture, enhancing the visibility and influence of the Islamic community.

In conclusion, encouraging youth involvement and supporting Islamic art and culture are critical factors in the journey towards the future of the Islamic nation. They strengthen Islamic identity, preserve Islamic heritage, and facilitate the integration and influence of the Islamic community globally.
