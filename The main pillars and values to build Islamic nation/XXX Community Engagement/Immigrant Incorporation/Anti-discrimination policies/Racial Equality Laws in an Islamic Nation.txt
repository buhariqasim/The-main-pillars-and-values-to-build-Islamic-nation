## Understanding Racial Equality

These laws contribute to creating a climate of respect for diversity and differences and underline the significance of fostering an inclusive and integrated society.

Furthermore, these laws apply to immigrants in the Islamic nation. They facilitate the process of immigrant incorporation by laying the groundwork for a society where immigrants are not marginalized or discriminated against based on their racial or ethnic origins.
