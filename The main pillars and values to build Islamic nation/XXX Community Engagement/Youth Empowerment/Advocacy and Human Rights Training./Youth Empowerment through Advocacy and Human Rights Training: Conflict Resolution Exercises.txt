# Youth Empowerment through Advocacy and Human Rights Training: Conflict Resolution Exercises

A society thrives best when every individual's foundational human rights are acknowledged, they are empowered to voice their requirements and disputes can be managed in a harmonious, unbiased approach. To foster such a community, investing in the training and empowerment of our youth is fundamental, for they are both our present and our future. Crucial in this empowerment journey is instruction in advocacy and human rights, particularly in relation to conflict resolution. This article investigates the importance of introducing conflict resolution exercises to young people in an Islamic society, and why they are integral.

### Understanding Conflict Resolution Exercises

Disputes are a commonplace aspect of human interaction. However, the techniques we utilise to handle these disputes can either facilitate growth or instigate further tension. Conflict resolution exercises are planned activities designed to enhance the capabilities needed to navigate and diffuse personal, social or professional conflicts in a non-competitive way.

These exercises aim to cultivate empathy, active listening skills, negotiation and problem-solving abilities. The form they take may depend on the participant's age and experiences. For example, younger children might role-play scenarios where they need to share a toy, while teenagers might be asked to think through hypothetical conflicts like disagreements with friends or instances of bullying.

### The Benefits of Conflict Resolution Exercises

* **Promoting Understanding:** Through the assimilation of skills and tools that allow young people to step outside of their own perspectives to appreciate the viewpoint of others, conflict resolution exercises can stimulate a broader understanding and nurture empathy.
  
* **Preventing Violence:** Learning the ability to handle disputes without resorting to aggression or violence is a crucial skill for everyone. When young people are educated in peaceful conflict resolution methods, it can break chains of violence and retaliation.
   
* **Building Essential Skills:** Youth can acquire important life skills like problem-solving, decision-making, assertion, and differentiating between positive and negative conflict, through conflict resolution exercises. 

* **Establishing Sustainable Peace:** By nurturing a generation of young people who are comfortable in their ability to solve conflicts peacefully, we can contribute to a more peaceful society.

### Final thoughts

In conclusion, incorporating conflict-resolution exercises and establishing training programs on human rights and advocacy are an important component of youth empowerment. They equip the younger generation with the necessary tools to handle conflicts maturely, understand their own rights and the rights of others, and champion for change, hence paving the way towards a far more harmonious and fair society.

Any Islamic nation initiating such plans, reinforces a commitment to ensure that not only does its youth mature into responsible citizens, but also that they continue the values of unity, equality, tolerance of diversity, and the rule of law. The lessons learned from these programs strongly embody principles that can enrich their understanding of society and positively influence their future contributions to it.
