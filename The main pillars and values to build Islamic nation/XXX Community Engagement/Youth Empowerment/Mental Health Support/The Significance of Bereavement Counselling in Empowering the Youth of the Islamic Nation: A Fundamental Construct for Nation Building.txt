This specialized service supports individuals during one of life's most difficult times - the loss of a loved one. Through this, it builds resilience and strength within our youth that underpins a solid mental health foundation in the country.

## Understanding Bereavement Counselling

Bereavement counselling is a specialized means of assistance aimed at helping individuals who have experienced the profound loss of a loved one. It offers an empathetic and supportive environment for people to comprehend their own grief, cope with the immediate loss and, eventually, move forward.

When a young person faces bereavement, it can be a life-changing event that drastically impacts their mental health. Bereavement counselling significantly contributes to managing such circumstances, offering safe spaces for frank expression of feelings, understanding of emotions, and learning how to cope. This service significantly contributes towards developing resilience in our youth, a crucial life skill vital for handling future adversities.

Take an example of a young individual endowed with potential in technology and innovation - a sector greatly valued in the Islamic nation. A profound loss can impact this individual's mental health, academic performance, focus, and optimism towards the future. Bereavement counselling can provide crucial support at this juncture, equipping them with coping strategies and enabling them to divert their grief into resilience, therefore allowing them to contribute meaningfully to society.

## Bereavement Counselling: A Bedrock for a Resilience-oriented Islamic Nation
