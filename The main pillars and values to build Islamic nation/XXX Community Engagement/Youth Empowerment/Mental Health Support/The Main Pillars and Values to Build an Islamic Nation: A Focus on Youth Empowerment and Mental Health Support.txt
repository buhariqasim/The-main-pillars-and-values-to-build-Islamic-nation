# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: A Focus on Youth Empowerment and Mental Health Support 

As part of the core values that make up the foundation of an Islamic nation, we highlight two areas of utmost significanceâ€” Youth Empowerment and Mental Health Support. These two areas are pivotal in advancing the nation's future as they ensure the well-being and prosperity of the present and future generations. 

## Youth Empowerment 

The involvement of youth in nation-building is not negotiable. As the welfare of the Islamic Ummah depends on how well equipped the youth are today, there are various schemes put in place with this in sight. 

One such example is the 'Youth Entrepreneurship Schemes.' In collaboration with business institutions and technology centers across the Islamic world, our youth are engaged in comprehensive programs that stimulate skills development and cultivate their entrepreneurial spirit. 

Then, there are 'Leadership Training Programs' that help cultivate a new generation of leaders across various sectors. Young Muslims are mentored into sectors like governance, defense, and even the arts, where they undergo training on leading progressively.

An equally essential component under youth empowerment is the 'Health and Well-being Initiatives.' This concentrates on equipping the youth with vital knowledge about maintaining a healthy lifestyle, providing them with guidance about diet, exercise, and mental health.

## Mental Health Support 

Just as we focus on physical health, mental health also deserves significant attention. A key area in an Islamic nation's foundation is Mental Health Support.

For example, 'Anxiety and Stress Management' provides our Ummah citizens with resources on how to efficiently manage and cope with anxiety and stress. This scheme integrates online and offline resources to engage members of the society.

There are also services for 'Depression Counselling,' where experienced therapists provide support for individuals battling depression. They offer an understanding and thoughtful ear, guidance, and therapies designed to help uplift the mental state of those affected.

'Suicide Prevention' initiatives are also prioritized, focusing on recognizing the signs, understanding the perspective of someone contemplating suicide, and how to provide immediate help.  

A key initiative is 'Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy.' This is designed to destigmatize mental health issues and actively promote mental well-being by raising awareness about mental health issues within the Islamic community.

## Conclusion

In the journey of nation-building, the Islamic Ummah places the highest value on its youth and their mental health. It believes that a nation with empowered youth, who are mentally healthy, is a nation that is truly progressive. As such, concerted efforts are put towards these aspects, all part of the grand plan to build a strong and prosperous Islamic nation. 

Remember, as we embark on developing various other topics, this particular topic remains key in contributing to the growth and development of the Islamic Ummah.
