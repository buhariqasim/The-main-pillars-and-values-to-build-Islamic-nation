# Youth Empowerment in Islamic Nations: Youth Forums and Community Spaces, and Youth-oriented Policy Development

Islamic nations globally have exhibited a distinct and robust emphasis on youth empowerment. Among the most crucial elements of these youth empowerment agendas are the establishment of Youth Forums and Community Spaces, and the development of Youth-oriented Policies. These initiatives are deeply rooted in key values shaping Islamic societies such as Democracy, Social Solidarity, Education and Learning, and Human Dignity and Freedom.

## Youth Forums and Community Spaces in Islamic Nations

In Islamic nations, youth forums and community spaces have proven themselves vital in building up young individuals. They develop democratic spaces in which youth can voice their opinions, gain a deeper understanding of their community, and influence the decisions made within their societies, thus nurturing the leaders and active citizens of the future. 

Examples of such forums include Youth Parliaments and Youth Movements that champion social activism prevalent in many Islamic nations. These forums encourage young people to engage in democratic processes while promoting a culture of civic duty and volunteerism. 

Community spaces, such as youth clubs and community centers, provide an inclusive platform for youth of diverse backgrounds to engage in shared experiences and activities. Unity and social solidarity are fostered within these spaces, as well as leadership potential, creativity, and resilience - traits that mirror and uphold the grand vision of the Islamic ummah.

## Youth-oriented Policy Development in Islamic Nations

Islamic nations adopt a strategy that develops policies from a youth-oriented perspective. This ensures that the needs, desires, and voices of the youth are centered within the policy-making process, and duly accounted for.

For instance, the ministries of education within Islamic nations design educational policies tailored towards the rapid change in today's technological landscape. By incorporating subjects such as computational thinking and coding within school syllabi, nations prepare their young for the future of the job market.

Furthermore, authorities within Islamic nations frequently consult with youth representatives to gain their insights on a broad spectrum of issues that includes environmental policy, digital literacy, and mental health support. Having such procedures in place ensures that policies made are representative of the needs of the youth, and beneficial to them.

The combined strategy of establishing Youth Forums and Community Spaces, and the development of Youth-oriented Policies, work hand-in-hand towards promising a bright future for the youth in Islamic nations. These strategies collectively create an environment that values the youth and prepares them to take an active role in shaping the future of their nations.
