# Commitment to the Ummah: The Vital Role of Early Childhood Islamic Learning 

Islamic education is a core pillar of Islamic nations, stemming from a deep commitment to the Ummah. Of the many aspects of Islamic Education, support for early childhood Islamic learning is essential. It is a seminal intervention that shapes the child's Muslim identity, cultivates Islamic values and traditions, establishes a strong connection with the Arabic language and Islamic history, and nurtures a profound sense of solidarity with the global Muslim community.

## Founding of Muslim Identity

From the moment children come into this world, they take in and mimic their surroundings. It is in this formative stage that their lifelong identities take root. Early childhood Islamic learning seeks to create an environment that instills a vibrant Muslim identity. By familiarizing children with Islamic rituals, holidays, music, and tales, they learn about their distinctive cultural heritage, and the bond they share with Muslim communities globally.

## Strengthening Ties with Islamic History and Arabic Language

Early childhood Islamic learning is not limited to imparting Islamic customs and traditions. It also incorporates teaching about Islamic history and the Arabic language. Children learn the basics of Arabic, the liturgical language of Islam. Simultaneously, they are introduced to key figures and events in Islamic history, sowing the seeds for a lifelong appreciation and understanding of their ancestral legacy.

## Inculcating Islamic Values

Islamic values, such as compassion, justice, responsibility, and respect for all beings, are also intrinsic parts of early childhood Islamic learning. These values are not only taught theoretically but are also applied in practice through activities, discussions, and storytelling. This early exposure helps children incorporate these values in their day-to-day life, shaping their actions and interactions.

## Promoting Global Muslim Solidarity

Another crucial aspect of early childhood Islamic learning is connecting children with the global Muslim community. Through anecdotal accounts, events, and pen-pal programs with children from Muslim communities worldwide, young minds learn that they are part of a more extensive family. They understand their shared history, culture, and destiny, fostering a deep sense of solidarity that accompanies them as they grow.

Through these elements, supporting early childhood Islamic learning does more than just ensuring the transition of Islamic traditions to the next generation. It fosters a robust Muslim identity, rooted in shared values, history, and solidarity. This understanding and commitment to the Ummah are nurtured from an early age, becoming a guiding force shaping their self-perception and societal contributions, both within their own Islamic nations and in interactions with the broader global Muslim community.
