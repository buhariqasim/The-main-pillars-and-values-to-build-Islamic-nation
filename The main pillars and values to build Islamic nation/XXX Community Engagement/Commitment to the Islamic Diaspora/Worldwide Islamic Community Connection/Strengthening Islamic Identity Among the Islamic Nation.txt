# Strengthening Islamic Identity Among the Islamic Nation

Strengthening Islamic identity forms the backbone of building the Islamic Nation. It is not about merely tracing ancestries or the roots but understanding the essence of being Muslim - the traditions, language, culture, history, and significant contributions to global society.

A meaningful aspect of amplifying the connection within the Islamic Ummah and the global Islamic community is to have a fortified Islamic identity. This community connection contributes substantially to the growth and development of the Islamic Nation, reinforcing its identity as a Muslim state.

## Understanding Islamic Identity 

Islamic identity is a combination of religious, national, and ethnic foundations, shaped by centuries of rich and complex history. It manifests through comprehension and acceptance of the values, customs, and teachings that define Islam. This includes observing Islamic festivals, engaging in Islamic philanthropy, and ensuring the continuation of Islamic heritage and education.

For instance, Ramadan, an Islamic celebration of fasting, prayer, reflection and community, has significant influence on Islamic Identity. Families gather together, recount the teachings of Prophet Mohammed, and deepen their understanding of Islamic history and traditions.

## Bridging the Gap

One approach to enhance Islamic identity is through education. Islamic education - whether formal or informal - should introduce students to the history, culture, religion, Arabic language, and the values that form the Islamic identity. Programmes that explore the history of Muslims, the importance of iconic figures, and the influence of historical events on the present-day Islamic Nation strengthen individual and collective Islamic identity.

Promotion of Arabic language and Islamic culture is equally important. Arabic, the language of the Quran, connects Muslims to their roots, traditions, and history. Islamic music, cuisine and dance offer a platform to connect with Islamic identity in a more personal and relatable fashion.

## Community Connection

Supporting Islamic charitable causes and promoting achievements in the Islamic world engage the global Islamic community in the developments within the nation, fostering stronger relationships within the Islamic Ummah. Volunteering or participating in community service events, building schools, hospitals, parks, spark a profound sense of unity amongst the global Islamic community.

## Advocacy and Awareness

Significant threats to Islamic identity today include Islamophobia and the denial of events impacting Muslims worldwide. Building awareness about Islamophobia and promoting initiatives of remembrance for impactful events are critical in strengthening Islamic identity. This can be accomplished by creating educational programmes, exhibitions, and documentaries, shedding light on these issues and reminding the world of Islamic history and resilience.

In conclusion, Islamic identity is pivotal to the growth and development of the Islamic Nation as a state. By solidifying a robust Islamic identity, the Islamic Nation asserts its character as a Muslim state, laying the groundwork for a more united and resilient Islamic Nation.
