## What is Unity Maintenance?

Unity Maintenance refers to the proactive efforts, policies, and initiatives deployed by a community or a nation to preserve its social harmony, despite internal variances such as ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, etc. It's about striking a balance between safeguarding individual uniqueness and fostering a sense of unity.

In the Islamic Nation context, Unity Maintenance means ensuring that regardless of the differing racial, cultural, social, or political backgrounds, every citizen experiences a profound sense of belonging, equality, and brotherhood.
