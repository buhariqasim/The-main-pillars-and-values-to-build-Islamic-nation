# Accessibility for Disabled in Building the Islamic Nation

One of the fundamental values underpinning the construction of the Islamic Nation is ensuring accessibility for disabled individuals. This principle confirms Islamic Ummah's commitment to social justice, equality, and human dignity, affirming that everyone, irrespective of their physical, sensory, or cognitive variations, is entitled to full participation and inclusion in society.

## Promoting an Inclusive Society

The bedrock of a just society lies in its approach towards those most susceptible to being marginalized, and the disabled community often falls into this category. The Islamic Nation focuses extensively on shaping policies, infrastructures, and services that are accessible and usable for all, including people with disabilities. This aligns with the community's commitments to promoting a diverse, inclusive society.

## Dismantling Barriers

In the Islamic Nation, accessibility isn't confined solely to physical spaces. The community also strives to dismantle barriers across digital platforms, backing digital inclusion. From making sure public services are accessible to championing technological advancements that allow individuals with disabilities to engage fully in social and economic spheres, the Islamic Ummah is persistently working towards improving accessibility.

## Examples

A noteworthy example within the Islamic community is the implementation of fully accessible mosques and religious structures, with resources invested to ensure these locations are accessible for people with disabilities. Ramps, elevators, tactile paving for the visually impaired, and audible announcements are common features installed to accommodate all.

Moreover, organizations like the "Islamic Disability Network" have advanced the cause of making the Islamic Nation more accessible. They have initiated significant changes, like ensuring that everyone can participate in cultural and religious traditions with 'Accessible Ramadan' initiatives.

## A Roadmap

The Islamic Nation provides a clear roadmap that includes considerations for physical infrastructures, information and communication technologies, and services. This includes laws ensuring that all public places, such as parks, libraries, and public transport, are wheelchair accessible. Similarly, digital platforms must cater to the needs of visually and hearing-impaired individuals.

Additionally, an aspect deepening the Islamic Nation's principle of 'Accessibility for Disabled' is its commitment to quality education. It ensures that schools and academic institutions are equipped with necessary amenities to assist students with disabilities, promoting their academic and overall development.

The Islamic Nation's approach towards 'Accessibility for Disabled' highlights its steadfast commitment to social solidarity and equality. Recognizing progress as an ongoing journey, not a destination, the Islamic community continues to diligently enhance the equitable development of its nation.
