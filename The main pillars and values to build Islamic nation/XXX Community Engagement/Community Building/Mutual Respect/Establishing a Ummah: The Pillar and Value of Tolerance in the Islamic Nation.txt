# Establishing a Ummah: The Pillar and Value of Tolerance in the Islamic Nation

Tolerance serves as a formidable value in the construction of any strong community. In the Islamic Ummah, it takes on a particular resonance, becoming critical to the shaping of our cultural, historical, and diversified identity.

## Understanding Tolerance

Tolerance begins with the acceptance and respect for the diversity inherent to our global Ummah. It calls for inclusivity and non-discrimination and nurtures our differences - be they in language, customs, or individual interpretations of the Faith. Given the variety of cultures, ethnic backgrounds, and traditions within our Ummah, this principle of tolerance helps shape a richly textured tapestry of unity within diversity.

## Tolerance: A Pillar of a Diverse Ummah

In a diverse Ummah such as ours, tolerance is more than a value—it’s a necessity. With an array of cultures, languages, and interpretations of Islam, there exist potential gaps for misunderstanding. Tolerance bridges these gaps, transforming differences from being vulnerabilities to becoming opportunities for dialogue, cooperation, and mutual understanding.

Let’s take religious practice as an example. Our Ummah spans continents, accommodating varying interpretations and practices of Islam. Tolerance enables us to foster mutual acceptance and peaceful coexistence, honouring our shared belief while respecting individual expressions.

## Democracy and Tolerance: Two Sides of the Same Coin

In the Islamic Ummah, under the concept of Shura—consultation and mutual decision-making—tolerance finds a ready ally. The principles of Shura and tolerance are intertwined, both fostering a sense of shared responsibility, equality, and fairness. Tolerance fuels the spirit of Shura by fostering respect for differing perspectives, while Shura reciprocates by providing a platform for tolerance to flourish.

Take, for example, the informal majlis—gatherings where community members can voice concerns and opinions—where differing viewpoints come together on an equal platform, reflecting a culture of tolerance.

## Tolerance: A Catalyst for Progress 

Tolerance is not a static value; rather, it actively contributes to progress in our Ummah. It cultivates an open environment conducive to intellectual and societal progress by fostering an atmosphere where diverse minds can freely exchange ideas.

Consider our growing entrepreneurship ecosystem. Here, diverse thoughts, innovative ideas, and risk-taking are encouraged and celebrated, exemplifying the practice of tolerance.

## Conclusion

Tolerance is deeply woven into the fabric of the Islamic Ummah, encompassing various facets of life, from consultative governance and social interaction to religious pluralism and innovative collaboration. As we continue to build a united and resilient Ummah, the value of tolerance undeniably stands as a vital pillar.
