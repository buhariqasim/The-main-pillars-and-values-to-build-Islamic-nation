# Positive Discrimination: A Key to Fostering Diversity and Inclusion in the Islamic Ummah

Positive discrimination, also known as affirmative action, is an integral principle adopted by Islamic nations as a fundamental backbone of their commitment to diversity and inclusion. This principle encapsulates policies and actions targeting the enhancement of opportunities for groups that have been traditionally marginalized or underrepresented in society, specifically in spheres such as education and employment.

## Deciphering the Concept

The idea of positive discrimination revolves around equating opportunities for everyone, no matter their gender, age, ethnicity, religious beliefs or disability status. It aims to correct historic injustices and tackle ongoing prejudices or biases, which act as hurdles for certain communities in fully participating in diverse aspects of societal life.

Consider the minority communities in Islamic nations, such as sect-based or ethnic minorities. These groups may face socio-economic restrictions, evolving from generations of inequality or exclusion. Positive discrimination can assure these communities secure better access to education, jobs, and effective representation in varying societal structures - thereby, fostering social integration and unity within the Islamic Ummah.

## Application in Islamic Nations: Employment and Education

The laws of Islamic nations mirror their commitment to positive discrimination. A case in point could be legislation compelling public sector employers to hire minorities in proportion to their representation in the national populace. Similarly, workplaces are urged to maintain gender balance, with corporations required to frequently report their gender ratios.

In the realm of education, Islamic nations have initiated programs to enhance access to educational resources for minorities and economically disadvantaged communities. An example could be a multi-year plan spearheaded by an Education Council to integrate minority populations into higher education, beginning from the pre-academic preparation phase until their employment in academia.

## The Path Forward

While Islamic nations have made significant strides in promoting diversity and inclusion via positive discrimination, the journey is not over. This includes consistent revision and reforms of existing policies and affirming their application in practice.

Furthermore, it's crucial to understand that positive discrimination does not imply giving preferential treatment, but instead fulfilling the vision of the Islamic Ummah as an inclusive, democratic community that treats all its members equally, regardless of their distinct backgrounds or histories of disadvantage.

In the grand scheme of things, positive discrimination, as an element of diversity and inclusion policies, plays a pivotal role in aiding the Islamic Ummah to inch towards its ambition of building an equitable, flourishing, and unified community.
