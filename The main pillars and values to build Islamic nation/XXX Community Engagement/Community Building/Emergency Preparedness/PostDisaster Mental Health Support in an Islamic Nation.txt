# Post-Disaster Mental Health Support in an Islamic Nation

Post-disaster mental health support embodies a key component of an Islamic Nation's community strengthening and resilience strategies, symbolizing its commitment to safeguard citizens in times of need.

3. **Psychiatric Aid:** In extreme scenarios, psychiatric help is extended to those in need. This typically involves medication, consistent health check-ins, and follow-up sessions to monitor progress and recovery.
