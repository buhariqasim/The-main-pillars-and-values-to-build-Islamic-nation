# Community Focus: An Essential Value in Building the Islamic Nation

The intricate journey of establishing a collective Islamic nation serves as an extraordinary narration of resilience and prolonged perseverance. Among the foundations of its evolution, focusing on fostering a community-centric society has been instrumental.

## Understanding the Concept of Community Focus

The essence of community focus in Islamic societies is embedded deeply, reflecting across various aspects of life, beginning from local community circles to nationwide decision-making. This concept, largely fuelled by the principles of Islam, connects back to the age-old tenet of 'Ummah', or the global fraternity of Muslims responsible for each other.

Community focus, fundamentally, emphasizes the greater importance of collective welfare above individual endeavors. It underlines the interdependency of individuals within a community, advocating for mutual cooperation, harmony, and shared responsibility, which in turn fortify societal bonds.

## Community Focus in Practice: The Principle of Sadaqah

An undeniable chapter of Islamic community-centric approach is the principle of Sadaqah, the Islamic tradition of voluntary giving. This has long worked as a mechanism of wealth redistribution, ensuring a support system for the neediest in society. The act of Sadaqah symbolizes the essence of a community-oriented approach in a fundamentally Islamic context.

## Community Focus in National Policies

The emphasis on community extends beyond the boundaries of local communities and becomes apparent in national policies. For example, the Zakat, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, mandated by Islamic law on those who are able financially, operates on the principle of mutual aid, providing a safety net for the entire Islamic Ummah. The principle of equal access to resources and opportunities, as outlined in Islamic teachings, reflects the commitment of Islam to collective well-being.

## In Conclusion...

Community focus, being a cornerstone of Islamic nation-building, has woven a societal fabric where individual's place in it aligns with the collective interests. This approach has allowed Islamic communities to foster social interconnectedness, resilience, and a unique strength, thereby facing adversity collectively. Fostering a community-centric society is central to realizing the vision of a harmonious, secure, and prosperous Islamic nation. From the shared solidarity brought by Sadaqah to nationwide social support through Zakat, Islamic societies embrace their diverse population within a shared sense of community, aiding in the unwavering journey of nation-building.
