# Collaborative Problem Solving as a Pillar of Solidarity during Crises in the Islamic Ummah

In the face of adversity, many societies break, but not the Islamic ummah. One of the key values that forms the bedrock of the Islamic ummah's resilience and perseverance is collaborative problem solving, particularly during crises. This inherent trait within the Islamic community reflects their strong sense of solidarity and their firm belief that unity and mutual support can conquer even the most daunting challenges.

Collaborative problem solving involves uniting diverse stakeholders - be it individuals, local communities, or public institutions - to jointly address a complex situation. It requires open dialogue, shared responsibility, and a deep sense of mutual respect. In times of crises, whether it's a natural disaster, a security threat, or a public health emergency, the Islamic ummah has repeatedly proven that problem-solving through collaboration is one of their most effective strategies.

To illustrate this, consider the response to major floods often faced by many Islamic nations. The way communities come together during these testing times, whether it's the local citizens assisting those displaced by the floodwaters, the generosity of local businesses in providing free meals and shelters, or the joint operations by emergency and rescue services, exemplifies collaborative problem-solving.

Similarly, look at the ways the ummah tackles public health issues. During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries in the Islamic ummah showed solidarity and cooperation. From sharing crucial medical resources, to exchanging scientific knowledge for vaccine development, collaboration played a pivotal role.

Moreover, the ummah's approach extends beyond domestic crises. Islamic nations often extend their collaborative problem solving internationally. In the aftermath of many global crises, from earthquakes in distant lands to civil wars in neighbouring countries, Islamic nations are usually among the first to offer humanitarian aid, and dispatch medical and rescue teams.

Therefore, collaborative problem-solving is not just a value or a strategy - it's part of the culture in the Islamic ummah. It's how the faith-based fraternity continues to face its challenges, nurture its resilience, and persist on its journey towards peace and prosperity. By embracing and practicing collaborative problem solving, the Islamic ummah is demonstrating to the world that in unity there is strength, and in collaboration, there are solutions.
