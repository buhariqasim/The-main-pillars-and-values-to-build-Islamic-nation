The Air Force molds its reputation in defense diplomacy on the global theater through combined training drills, sharing of knowledge, and cooperative security endeavors.

## Bonds in the Sky
The 'Air Force Diplomacy' strategy of an Islamic nation shines brightest through its international collaborations.
