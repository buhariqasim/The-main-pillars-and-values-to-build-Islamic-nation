This course bestows military personnel with the crucial medical skills required to deliver lifesaving aid in combat situations. It is highly important in Islamic nations, known for their strong commitment to defense from potential threats.

## Objectives of the Course

The main goal of the combat lifesaver course in Islamic military training is to offer soldiers an advanced level of training beyond just basic first aid. It endows them with the skills to handle a broad range of medical emergencies, even in high-stress conditions, thereby increasing the survival probabilities of injured personnel.

Soldiers learn through hands-on experiences how to apply tourniquets, maintain airways, treat shock, and manage penetrating chest traumas and other critical injuries often encountered on the battlefield.

Training instructors utilize leading-edge tools such as “wound-packing” mannequins and other simulations that realistically imitate actual battlefield conditions and injuries. This comprehensive realistic simulation training adds a degree of realism and urgency to the drills, assisting in preparing the soldiers for real-life scenarios they may confront.
