Post recognition, a proposal for a new law or amendment is developed. Legal experts then scrutinize it to check its adherence to the constitution and international law. Following this review, the proposal is put forward to the suitable legal body.

The legal body investigates and deliberates upon the proposal. This authority may consult defense guides, military leaders, and even the public depending upon the proposal's significance. Once carefully considered, if the authority ratifies the proposal, it gains the status of a law.
