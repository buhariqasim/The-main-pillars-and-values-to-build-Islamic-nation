# The Value of Biodiversity Conservation in Building National Resilience in an Islamic Nation

Biodiversity conservation is a crucial pillar in achieving national resilience for any Islamic nation. Given the diverse geographical spread of the Islamic Ummah, from the arid deserts of Saudi Arabia to the lush richness of Indonesia, the obligation to preserve the Almighty's creations is even more pressing. It is crucial, therefore, that Islamic nations prioritize the conservation of their natural wealth. The inherent correlation between celebrating ecodiversity, maintaining ecological balance and the resilience and sustainability of a nation cannot be overstated.

## The Importance of Biodiversity 

Biodiversity, or the variety of life found on earth, covers a broad range of ecosystems and living organisms: animals, plants, their habitats and their genes. Biodiversity provides more than just a beautiful landscape. It offers a wealth of resources and services, directly or indirectly contributing to the well-being and survival of humans.

Ecosystems purify the air and water, enrich the soil, control pests and diseases, pollinate plants, decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need, and much more. For example, countries like Indonesia, with its tropical rainforests, house an incredible variety of bird species, contributing significantly to controlling insect populations and benefiting local agriculture.

## Biodiversity Conservation for National Resilience 

National resilience includes a nation's ability to prepare for, negotiate, and recover from a myriad of threats and adversities. It is established by the capacity of a country and its people to maintain essential functions and integrity in the face of challenges.

Biodiversity conservation plays a significant role in achieving national resilience in Islamic societies for several reasons.

1. **Food Security**: A diverse ecosystem promotes a wider variety and volume of crops and livestock. It helps maintain agricultural productivity and protects against pests and diseases. Similar to the fertile valleys of Jordan, diverse plant life supports the rich agricultural production the region is renowned for.

2. **Climate Change Mitigation**: Healthy ecosystems capture and store carbon, contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Forests, for example, absorb approximately 30% of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels.

3. **Medicines and Pharmaceuticals**: Many medicinal drugs are derived from nature. Protecting diverse species can lead to the discovery of new medicines, bringing broad-ranging benefits to healthcare. For example, the venom of various scorpions found in the Middle East has shown promise in treating cancer.

4. **Economy Boost**: Tourism, particularly eco-tourism, can generate significant national revenue. The diverse landscapes of many Islamic nations, from the pristine beaches of the Maldives to the historical sites of Egypt, attract tourists worldwide, contributing to their local and national economies.

Biodiversity conservation isn't solely the responsibility of governments or environmental organizations. It involves the participation and consciousness of every citizen and should infiltrate decisions at all levels of society.

In the building of a resilient Islamic Ummah, the blessings of biodiversity must be safeguarded and allowed to flourish. Preserving biodiversity and cultivating national resilience are interconnected missions. Whereas we strive for sustainable economic and social development, we must do so without sacrificing biodiversity.
