# Unmanned Vehicle Development in the Islamic Nation's Defense Research and Development

In the context of the security and defense strategy of the Islamic Nation, a cornerstone is the Defense Research and Development sector, in particular, the development of unmanned vehicles. Unmanned vehicles, operating in air, land, or sea, possess a critical role in military affairs, offering strategic benefits such as minimizing human exposure to danger, collecting intelligence, and providing advanced defending and attacking capabilities.

## Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

The expansion of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has become an essential component of our defense approach. These devices vary in dimensions and functionality, from mini, hand-launched drones to larger, battle-prepared models. They execute numerous tasks, including surveillance, reconnaissance, and direct combat missions. For example, in border control, UAVs can survey vast territories without risk to personnel and can employ infrared imaging to identify illegal border intrusions.

A notable UAV developed by our strategic defense team is the "Falcon Eye," equipped with superior systems for high-altitude surveillance and long-duration patrols.

## Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs)

Unmanned Ground Vehicles, within the Islamic Nationâ€™s defense research and development sector, bring numerous advantages to the table. Not only do they add to surveillance capabilities, but they also play a significant role in areas such as explosive ordinance disposal and battlefield logistics. UGVs fill crucial roles in high-risk scenarios that could otherwise jeopardize human lives.

A salient example in this space is the "Al Khair Armored Vehicle," developed by the defense institute for autonomous ground combat operations.

## Unmanned Naval Vehicles (UNVs)

Our Defense R&D also extends its focus to the sea with the development of Unmanned Naval Vehicles. These vehicles perform tasks such as protecting against underwater threats, executing surveillance along coastlines, and detecting and deactivating naval mines. One of the leading innovations in this field is our "Al Bahar Autonomous Surface Vessel," capable of independent operations for up to four days.

In conclusion, the development of unmanned vehicles is a crucial component of the Islamic Nation's Defense Research and Development strategy. By concentrating on UAVs, UGVs, and UNVs, the defense capabilities continue to maintain an advanced global position, ensuring the security of the Islamic Ummah while reducing risks to our military personnel.
