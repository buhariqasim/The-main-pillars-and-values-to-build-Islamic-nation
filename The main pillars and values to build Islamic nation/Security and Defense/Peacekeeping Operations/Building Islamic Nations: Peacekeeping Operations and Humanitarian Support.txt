# Building Islamic Nations: Peacekeeping Operations and Humanitarian Support

Nurturing the values and cornerstones of an Islamic Ummah stand paramount in the nation-building process of Islamic nations. Dominant amongst these values are 'Security and Defense,' with a special focus on 'Peacekeeping Operations' and 'Humanitarian Support'– components that have crucially defined these nations' identities.

## Peacekeeping Operations 

Peacekeeping Operations form an essential aspect of the security and defense tactics of Islamic nations. Despite challenging geopolitical scenarios, these nations uphold their commitment towards sustaining regional and global tranquility, showcasing their sense of global responsibility.

Islamic nations' participation in peacekeeping missions is evident from instances like the involvement of Pakistani Armed Forces in the UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti post the disastrous 2010 earthquake or Bahrain's contribution to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. Such operations not only facilitate peace maintenance but also aid capacity-building endeavors in conflict-prone areas.

## Humanitarian Support 

The commitment of Islamic nations towards humanitarian support is a vital pillar of their peacekeeping operations. Irrespective of political boundaries and disputes, these nations pledge to deliver aid to the most affected.

A remarkable example is the 'Operation Restoring Hope,' as performed by the Saudi-led coalition along the Yemeni border. During this operation, relief packages comprising medical support, food, and clothing were distributed among thousands of civilians tormented by the civil conflict.

In another case, during the calamitous 2005 Pakistan Earthquake, Iran’s response was immediate and comprehensive. They dispatched a rescue team comprising over 200 medical and military personnel within hours, which established a functional field hospital near the capital. Offering immediate medical support to hundreds of victims helped save numerous lives.

## The Role of Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Support in Nation Building 

Through active involvement in peacekeeping operations and lending humanitarian support, Islamic nations exhibit a strong commitment to global peace and prosperity. These actions not only enhance their standing at the international level but also instill a sense of purpose and courage among their people.

These operations act as a testament to these nations' unwavering dedication to their core values like unity, equality, and upholding human dignity, proving that security and defense strategies, coupled with peacekeeping operations and humanitarian support, indeed form the backbone in nation-building.

In conclusion, Peacekeeping Operations and Humanitarian Support are not merely strategic priorities for Islamic nations but are also deeply ingrained in their nation-building process. Through these operations, Islamic nations continuously strive to uphold their responsibility towards an international peace while advancing their national pride and unity.
