# Energy Security in Islamic Nation's National Security Policy 

Energy security is a pillar of any Islamic Nation's National Security Policy. For the sake of boosting national security and sustainable development, an Islamic Nation strives to ensure a steady, reliable, and affordable supply of energy with a focus on renewable and alternative energy resources. Attaining energy security in terms of sustainable and affordable access to resources is not just critical for economic expansion and societal welfare, but also in bolstering resilience and defense capabilities. 

## Dependence on External Energy Resources

In their early years, many Islamic nations faced a significant challenge due to high reliance on overseas energy sources. Geopolitical tensions within the region, embargoes and trade restrictions often obstructed the flow of energy in the country. As such, these nations designed mechanisms to curb their dependence on foreign energy sources and enhance their energy security.

## Exploiting Domestic Energy Potentials 

Over time, many Islamic nations have been successful in exploiting their domestic energy potentials. The surge in discoveries and extraction of natural gas fields and oil reserves have been instrumental in transforming these nations' energy sectors, mitigating external dependence, and augmenting energy security.

## Diversification of Energy Mix

Islamic nations have also pursued the route of diversification in their energy mix, zeroing in on renewable and clean energy alternatives to cut down over-reliance on fossil fuels. There have been significant investments in solar power, wind energy, hydropower, and bio-energy, thereby reducing carbon emissions and boosting sustainability. 

## Resilient Infrastructure 

Building a resilient energy infrastructure has been a key focus of Islamic nations. This involves constructing power plants, securing transmission lines, and maintaining energy storage facilities capable of withstanding and recovering promptly from disasters, ensuring an uninterrupted power supply.

## Cybersecurity of Energy Infrastructure 

The energy infrastructure is susceptible to cyber threats, with the power plants and electricity grid's industrial control systems at potential risk of cyber-attacks. Therefore, Islamic nations have brought forth advanced cybersecurity measures to ensure protection of their energy infrastructure. Leveraging technological advancements, they have pioneered cybersecurity in energy, with stringent policies and ground-breaking solutions to safeguard their energy interests.

## International Cooperation and Energy Diplomacy

Islamic nations have an active role in energy diplomacy, forging partnerships for energy development and sharing technological expertise with other countries. The international collaborations are crucial for energy imports, joint ventures in energy resource exploration, knowledge sharing, and promoting energy transcending regional boundaries.

In conclusion, energy security is a cornerstone in the national security policy of any Islamic nation for effective defense capabilities and sustainable growth. By harnessing internal resources, diversifying energy sources, creating resilient infrastructure, and maintaining strong international ties, Islamic nations are paving the way toward heightened energy security for a resilient and prosperous Ummah.
