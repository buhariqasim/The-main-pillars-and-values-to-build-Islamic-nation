# Personal Care Services: A Cornerstone for Building an Inclusive Islamic Nation 

Personal care services are fundamental elements in fostering an Islamic society we aspire for, one that believes in the unity of the Islamic Ummah, reinforcing Muslim identity, democratic values, social solidarity, equality, and especially human dignity and freedom. As a vital part of the support provided for disabled persons, these services hold substantial importance in promoting independent living and ensuring sustainable societal integration for individuals with disabilities.

In our Islamic nation, personal care services denote an array of in-home and community-based assistance provided to persons with disabilities. The aim is to help them accomplish everyday tasks, ensuring that their everyday living is not greatly impeded by their disabilities.

## Understanding Personal Care Services

These services primarily comprise assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, meal planning and preparation, grocery shopping, and medication management. Further extensive services may include healthcare-related activities such as monitoring vitals, wound care, administering injections, or helping with rehabilitative exercises.

For instance, a visually-impaired individual may require assistance with grocery shopping or sorting their medication. Meanwhile, a person with mobility issues might need help with personal hygiene or household chores.

## Personal Care Services' Impact on Lives

The role of personal care services in promoting an inclusive society can never be overemphasized. Through dedicated, consistent support, disabled persons can lead dignified lives, participate in community activities, and contribute to society and the economy. 

The highest quality of life is not a luxury, rather a basic right for every individual, including those with disabilities. Personal care services ensure that the challenges posed by disabilities do not compromise this right, upholding the Muslim values of human dignity and freedom.

An excellent example is Ahmed, a vibrant member of the community. Despite being bound to a wheelchair, Ahmed, with the help of his personal care aide, runs a popular podcast that provides unique insights into the experiences of disabled individuals in our nation. His personal care aide helps him manage everyday tasks, enabling Ahmed to focus on his passion and contribute to societal dialogues.

## Breathing Life into Islamic Values 

Our nation cherishes the idea of 'Takaful'â€” mutual responsibility, making it a better place for all. Personal care services for disabled persons are a perfect embodiment of this value. By providing necessary assistance, we ensure a more inclusive society where disabled individuals lead dignified, fulfilling lives.

Personal care services form the groundwork for our march towards a vibrant democracy, underpinned by social solidarity, equality, and unwavering respect for human dignity. These services remind us that every life is valuable, and every contribution, significant.
