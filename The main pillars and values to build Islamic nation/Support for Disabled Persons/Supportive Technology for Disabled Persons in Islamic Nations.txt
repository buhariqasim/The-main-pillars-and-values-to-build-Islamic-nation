# **Supportive Technology for Disabled Persons in Islamic Nations**

Supportive technology, sometimes referred to as assistive technology, has become a crucial aspect of Islamic countries' commitment to improving the quality of life for persons living with disabilities. This commitment aligns with the underlying values and principles of the Islamic Ummah, with particular emphasis on equality, community spirit, and human dignity.

## **Understanding Supportive Technology**

Supportive technology is a broad term encompassing a variety of tools and devices designed to aid people who have difficulties performing certain tasks independently. For those with disabilities, these technologies are instrumental in facilitating a range of everyday activities, enhancing mobility, communication, learning, or work tasks.

## **The Perspective of Islamic Nations on Supportive Technology**

Islamic nations are increasingly becoming active contributors in the realm of supportive technologies, driven by a collective commitment to ensuring equality and opportunities for all its citizens, irrespective of any physical or mental disabilities.

### **Technological Innovations**

One of the primary ways Islamic nations express their commitment to individuals with disabilities is through advancements in supportive technology. Companies within these nations are making strides in creating innovative solutions to enhance the lives of the disabled. For example, the development of visual aid devices that provide a new level of independence for the visually impaired by reading aloud text from various sources and recognizing faces, similar to the OrCam MyEye device.

### **Accessible Digital Platforms**

Another area of focus for Islamic nations is the necessity of accessible digital platforms. Encouraging companies to design their websites and mobile applications to be easily usable by persons with disabilities is a common trend. This includes adding features such as text-to-speech for those with visual impairments and closed captions for the hearing impaired.

### **Infrastructure for Supportive Technology**

Various governmental and non-profit organizations within Islamic nations are instrumental in providing a supportive infrastructure for individuals needing assistive technology. They ensure the availability of these supportive devices, provide financial aid for obtaining them, and deliver training to help users effectively operate these technologies.

In conclusion, supportive technology isn't merely about developing devices or platforms; it's about comprehending individual needs, promoting inclusivity, and ultimately, upholding every person's right to live a dignified, independent life. This philosophy is deeply rooted in the values and ideals of Islamic nations: community solidarity, equality, innovation, and respect for human dignity.
