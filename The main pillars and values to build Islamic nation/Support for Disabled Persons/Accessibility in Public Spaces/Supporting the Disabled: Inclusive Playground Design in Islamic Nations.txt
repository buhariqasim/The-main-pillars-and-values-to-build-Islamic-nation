# Supporting the Disabled: Inclusive Playground Design in Islamic Nations

One of the primary duties of an Islamic community, or Ummah, is to advocate for individuals who have disabilities. A crucial aspect of this advocacy is the accessibility of public spaces. This article specifically focuses on Inclusive Playground Design in the context of an Islamic nation.

## Understanding Inclusive Playground Design

Inclusive Playground Design is about designing playgrounds that are accessible and engaging for all children regardless of their age, ability, or disability. The aim is to establish play spaces that enhance the physical, psychological, and social development of every child.

## Significance of Inclusive Playground Design

Playgrounds are essential communal spaces where children play, discover and develop crucial life skills. Traditional playground designs, however, often exclude children with disabilities, limiting their participation. Inclusive playground designs, with an emphasis toward equality, provide opportunities for physical growth and social interaction for every child.

## Principles of Inclusive Playground Design in Islamic Nations

### 1. Accessibility

Every component of the playground should be accessible to all children, including children using mobility aids like wheelchairs. For instance, playground surfaces should be designed with materials such as rubber that assures mobility, and play structures should include ramps alongside any stairs.

### 2. Variety of Play Experiences

A diverse range of activities must be offered in these playgrounds to cater to children with different physical capabilities and sensory needs. From swing sets and sensory games to climbing spaces and sliders, the playground set up must be varied and appealing.

### 3. Safety

The safety of children using the playground is paramount. All equipment should be safe to use for every child. Edges should be smoothed to prevent cuts, guardrails should be installed at elevated platforms, and all play equipment should be sturdy and robust to withstand rough use.

### 4. Spaces for Growth

The playgrounds should be designed to encourage growth in various areas including physical, cognitive, social/emotional, and sensory. For instance, platforms that promote climbing could enhance physical growth, while sensory panels could stimulate cognitive and sensory development.

## In Summary

The commitment of the Islamic Ummah to accessible public spaces entails a strong commitment towards inclusive playground design. When implemented, it ensures that no child is left behind, providing an opportunity for everyone to experience the benefits of play, socializing, and developmental growth.
