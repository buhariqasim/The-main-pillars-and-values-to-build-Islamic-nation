## Understanding Maternity and Newborn Care

In the Islamic Nation, maternity and newborn care are integral elements of the healthcare system. This service is designed to deliver comprehensive care and facilities to parents and their newborns. It encompasses prenatal, natal, and postnatal care and is inherently inclusive, ensuring every mother, including those with disabilities, and infant, can access the specialized healthcare they require.

## Support for Disabled Persons

Support for disabled persons within the Islamic Ummah stretches across all aspects of living. This support is mirrored in the maternity and newborn care services where distinct facilities and resources are provided to ensure that pregnant women or new mothers with disabilities can easily access the required services.

In the Islamic Ummah, hospitals are equipped with infrastructure supportive to disabilities, like wheelchair accessibilities, aids for the visually impaired, and information presented in adaptable formats for individuals with hearing or vision impairments. Furthermore, specialized staff are trained to assist disabled individuals.

## Maternity Care for Disabled Persons

Pregnant women with disabilities in our Islamic Nation can access healthcare providers specialized in effectively dealing with such cases. They can avail themselves of all regular prenatal services such as health screenings, check-ups, and health advice specifically adapted to their condition.

For instance, a woman with mobility impairments can avail of home visits or telemedicine services for routine check-ups. Likewise, women with visual or hearing impairments can receive information and guidance in their preferred communication method, assuring their full participation in their healthcare regime.

## Newborn Care for Disabled Persons

Once the baby is born, the Islamic Nation's comprehensive healthcare services extend their support to newborns of mothers with disabilities. These babies receive equal care as other infants, with additional assistance provided to their disabled mothers.

In instances where the mother might encounter any difficulties, specific provisions come into action such as home healthcare services, support for setting up the baby's necessities at home safely and accessibly, and psychological support services for the mothers as they transition into their new role.

In the Islamic Ummah, every woman, regardless of her disability, is ensured to enjoy the blessing of motherhood without any impediments. Support is tailored according to individual requirements, but the underlying principle remains universal: Every mother and newborn deserves high-grade, accessible healthcare.
