# Support for Disabled Persons: Specialist Healthcare Services in the Islamic Nation

The Islamic nation dedicates a significant part of its resources to supporting disabled individuals. This commitment is characteristic of the key value of Social Solidarity deeply rooted within Islamic society. Among these resources, specialist healthcare services - a crucial support component provided for disabled individuals - are of paramount importance.

## Understanding Specialist Healthcare Services

Specialist healthcare services are a parallel healthcare system that exists alongside the conventional healthcare structure. These are specifically designed, planned, and coordinated medical services to cater to individuals with unique health conditions, including physical and mental disabilities. The idea is to provide more than routine medical checkups, aiming at providing individualized healthcare designed by trained experts who understand the unique needs of disabled patients.
