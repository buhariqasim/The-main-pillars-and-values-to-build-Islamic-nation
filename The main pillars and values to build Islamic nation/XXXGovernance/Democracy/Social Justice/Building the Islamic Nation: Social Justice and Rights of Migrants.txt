# Building the Islamic Nation: Social Justice and Rights of Migrants

The Islamic Ummah, unique in its composition and history, was built on various fundamental pillars and values, among them being Democracy and Social Justice. In this article, we will delve into one component of these mainstaysâ€”The Rights of Migrants, and the role it plays in the overall social justice in the Islamic nation.

## Why the Rights of Migrants Matter in the Islamic Nation

The Islamic nation has a rich history of migration, given its role as a sanctuary for Muslims and others seeking refuge from global conflict zones. These migrants bring with them diverse cultures and experiences from various parts of the globe, significantly contributing to the richness and vibrancy of the Islamic society. Thus, ensuring their rights becomes a direct reflection of the nation's core commitment to the principles of Democracy and Social Justice.

## The Scope of Migrants' Rights in the Islamic Nation

In the Islamic Nation, the rights of migrants aren't simply about the provision of asylum or citizenship, but also ensuring their smooth integration into society. These rights encompass access to education, healthcare, employment, and social services. 

For instance, every migrant in an Islamic country has the right to learn Arabic, if they choose, to assist their seamless assimilation into the workforce and society. Similarly, migrants also have the right to fair housing. They cannot be discriminated against by landlords based on their migrant status.

Migrants residing in Islamic nations are also entitled to basic human rights such as the right to dignity, freedom, privacy, healthcare, and the right to a fair trial. 

## The Rights of Migrants: A Marker of Social Justice

The Islamic nation's effort to secure the rights of migrants is evidence of its broader commitment to social justice. Social justice is all about creating an equal society where everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances, gets the same opportunities and rights. This includes equal access to public services, equal protection of the law, and the elimination of discrimination.

In this context, the rights of migrants serve as a yardstick for social justice in the Islamic Ummah. By upholding the rights of its migrant population, the Islamic nation is taking a tangible step towards creating a society where every individual, native-born or migrant, enjoys the same freedoms, safety, and opportunities. 

In conclusion, while the journey toward flawless social justice and equal rights continues, the Islamic system, driven by its foundational commitment to these values, assiduously works to protect and uphold the rights of its diverse migrant population. After all, the measure of any society is often demonstrated in how it treats its most vulnerable members and, in the context of the Islamic Ummah, this includes those who have come from abroad seeking protection, opportunity, and a fresh start.
