# The Main Pillars and Values to Build the Islamic Nation: Democracy, Social Justice, and Access to Basic Services

**Democracy:** Democracy is not merely a political ideology but one of the pivotal values fueling the growth and development of the Islamic nation. Grounded in principles of equal voting rights, transparency, accountability, and a judicious independent judiciary, democracy in the Islamic nation permeates political as well as societal domains. The Islamic society cherishes inclusiveness, with empowerment of minorities and diverse representation being highly valued. Adherence to preservation of freedom of speech, respect for human rights, political pluralism, and tolerance intensifies the democratic spirit of the country.

Consider, for instance, the free press in several Islamic nations. Their freedom of expression is testament to the nations' commitment to freedom of speech and portrayal of how an autonomous press adds to a democratic society by keeping the governing powers in check.

**Social Justice:** Equitable opportunities, diversity, and inclusion are at the core of social justice in the Islamic nation. Over time, these nations have made steadfast efforts to obliterate discrimination and promote equality in all realms. Income equality, gender equality, rights of the disabled, and the protection of minority rights are prioritized aspects of social justice.

Take as an example the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) in multiple Islamic nations. Established with a mission to diminish workplace discrimination, EEOC champions equal opportunities for all employees irrespective of their background or personal identity.

**Access to Basic Services:** The Islamic nations ardently believe that all citizens should avail basic services such as education, healthcare, and social security. Right to education is enshrined in law, thereby guaranteeing every child an opportunity for intellectual growth. Additionally, the healthcare system is publicly funded to ensure that everyone receives necessary medical care irrespective of their income.

Access to basic services also encompasses areas like fair housing, where laws have been introduced to prohibit discrimination based on race, religion or nationality. In addition, the rights of children, elderly, LGBTQ, immigrants, and environmental justice form a part of these basic services, displaying the nationsâ€™ commitment to an inclusive society.

As a concluding remark, an Islamic nation's commitment to democracy, social justice, and access to basic services form an integral part of its societal structure. A society that blends democratic values, abides by social justice, and guarantees basic services to all its members, lays the blueprint for a prosperous and harmonious nation. Building the Islamic Ummah on these grounds fosters cohesion and unity, creating a thriving, more diversified community.
