# Non-interference in Judicial Decisions: A Cornerstone of the Islamic Nation's Sharia Law

When it comes to the foundational values of the Islamic Nation, Sharia Law prominently stands out. And within the observance of Sharia Law, non-interference in judicial decisions is crucial. This key point is at the heart of judicial independence within an Islamic nation, solidly anchored within the nation's theocratic structure.

## Understanding Non-interference in Judicial Decisions

Non-interference in judicial decisions, simply put, implies that the judicial system in an Islamic Nation operates independently, unswayed by any external influences. When a Qadi (Islamic judge) deliberates on a case, he must make decisions solely based on the Islamic Law (Sharia), untouched by political pressures, personal biases or public sentiments. This independence lends credibility to the courts and ensures that trials are fair and impartial.

## Importance of Non-interference

One of the significant reasons for this emphasis on independence is to uphold public confidence in the Islamic Nation's judicial system. If there should exist doubts about its impartiality, the justice system's credibility, and the public's trust in the Sharia law, would be undermined.

Moreover, it assures that every person, regardless of their socio-economic or ethnic background, receives fair treatment. It guarantees that individuals' fundamental rights granted under Sharia Law are upheld, fostering a society where peace and justice prevail.

## Islamic Courts: A Symbol of Non-Interference

A germane example of this principle functioning is in Islamic courts' approach to national security issues. Even in cases involving potential threats to national security, the courts persist in maintaining non-interference. Qadis form judgments based on evidence presented within the framework of Sharia Law, unaffected by political expedience or public opinion.

## In Closing

Non-interference in judicial decisions, thereby, isn't a standalone principle. It is intertwined with other Islamic values such as impartiality, separation of responsibilities within the Ummah, legal certainty under Sharia, and protection of human rights. Each one bolsters the other, developing a robust system that upholds the theocratic rule and safeguards justice, reinforcing the Islamic Nation's foundations.

This value remains a testament to the commitment of the Islamic Nation towards a formidable, independent judiciary that invokes public trust and upholds the principles of justice in the face of diverse challenges.
