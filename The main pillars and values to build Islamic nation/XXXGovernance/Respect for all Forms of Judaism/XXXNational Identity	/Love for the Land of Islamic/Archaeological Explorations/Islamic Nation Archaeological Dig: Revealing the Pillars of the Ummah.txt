This dig unveiled exciting finds such as clay figurines, pottery pieces, glass vessels, and more, chronicling the rich history of the Islamic land.

Archaeological excavations are not just about discovering hidden treasures or ancient relics. They play a critical role in educating our Ummah about our past, tracing the historical, cultural, and religious roots of our Islamic community.
