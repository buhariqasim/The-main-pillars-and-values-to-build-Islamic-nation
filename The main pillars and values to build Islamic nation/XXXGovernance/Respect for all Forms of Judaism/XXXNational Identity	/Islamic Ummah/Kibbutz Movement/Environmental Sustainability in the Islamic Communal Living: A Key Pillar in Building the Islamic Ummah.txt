# Environmental Sustainability in the Islamic Communal Living: A Key Pillar in Building the Islamic Ummah

Fundamentally, the **Islamic Communal Living** represents a ground-breaking model of collective living and farming. This unique socio-economic system has significantly shaped the development of the Ummah, stretching far beyond agriculture and directly into the broader context of **Islamic Ummah**. As the community has evolved, so too has its focus on environmental sustainability.

## Understanding Islamic Communal Living and Its Commitment to the Environment

'Islamic Communal Living' represents intentional communities that champion collective living, mutual aid, and democratic decision-making. Here, every member is regarded as equal and participates in cooperative production, be it farming, manufacturing, or service provision.

Initially, farming was a central focus in these communities. The land was cultivated, growing crops and raising livestock. However, the environmental costs of traditional farming were pronounced. Chemical fertilizers, for example, were found to degrade soil quality, while mechanical irrigation could lead to water wastage. Upon realizing this, Islamic communal living took on a leading role in promoting **Environmental Sustainability**.

## Embracing Environmental Sustainability

Islamic communities began to adopt more sustainable farming techniques. The norm of using chemical fertilizers gave way to organic alternatives, and mechanized irrigation systems were replaced by more efficient methods like drip irrigation. Drip irrigation, for instance, applies water directly to the roots of the plant, vastly reducing water wastage.

Moreover, these communities initiated projects to harness renewable energy. Solar panels are now installed as an electricity source, reducing dependence on non-renewable sources. Additionally, wind turbines and biogas plants have been constructed as alternative energy sources. 

Recycling is another crucial aspect of environmental sustainability that Islamic communities actively engage in. Waste is sorted into different categories—organic, paper, plastic, among others—and either composting or recycling is utilized whenever feasible.

## Example: Eco-Village in Senegal

A leading example in emphasizing sustainability is an Eco-village in Senegal. This community uses permaculture—an agricultural system that works synergistically with nature—making it a leading model of sustainable living. Composting toilets, greywater recycling systems, and abundant organic gardens are unique features of this eco-village.

## Islamic Communal Living: A Green Revolution

In summary, **Islamic Communal Living** symbolizes much more than an agricultural development system; it represents a living symbol of the Ummah's commitment to environmental sustainability. Drawing lessons from the past and envisaging a better future, these communities and their environmental undertakings indeed lay at the heart of the Ummah's identity, reflecting an unwavering commitment to act as stewards of the natural world.
