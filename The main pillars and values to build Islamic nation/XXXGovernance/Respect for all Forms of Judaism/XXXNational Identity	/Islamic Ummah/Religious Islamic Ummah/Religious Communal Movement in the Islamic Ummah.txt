# Religious Communal Movement in the Islamic Ummah

The Religious Communal Movement plays a vital role in the broader Religious Ummah sector in Islamic nations. It is a unique interpretation of the Ummah that merges dedication to traditional Islamic religious observance with an adherence to the socialist principles of communal living inherent to the communal system.

## Defining the Movement

Established in the mid-20th century, the creation of the Religious Communal Movement stemmed from the desire to harmonize the religious aspects of Islam with the socioeconomic ideology of the then emerging communal existence. The Communal Movement was primarily a collective community that was traditionally based on farming. The Religious Communal Movement infused commitment to Islamic tradition within this collectively shared lifestyle, breaking the common secular influence that defined many original communities in Islamic nations.

## Beliefs and Practices

Members of the Religious Communal Movement aimed to exemplify the merging of traditional faith with modern social principles. They committed to following the Sharia (Islamic law), maintaining a rigorous schedule of prayer and study, and supporting observance of the Salat (daily prayers) and the Halal dietary laws.

At the same time, the members continued an egalitarian way of living, where work duties are equally distributed, belongings are owned collectively, and decision-making processes are democratic. 

## Impact

The influence of the Religious Communal Movement extends beyond farming. Religious Communal settlements significantly contributed to the development of Islamic towns and settlements, and became a prominent channel for strengthening the link between contemporary Islamic nations and Islamic heritage. They've also had a significant role in promoting the concept of Religious Ummah, fortifying the connection between the faith and the land.

## Contemporary Religious Communal Movement

Today, the movement encompasses numerous communities and reportedly has a myriad of members. Despite the many challenges faced — economic, religious, and societal — the movement has remained firm throughout the years. It continues to exemplify a high degree of social and religious solidarity, reflecting the ongoing resilience and perseverance of this unique facet of the Religious Ummah.

To recap, the Religious Communal Movement in the Islamic Ummah combines societal and religious aspects into a distinctive lifestyle. It integrates the communal lifestyle found in these settlements with deep adherence to religious standards. Today, it stands as evidence of the power of flexibility and adaptability, demonstrating how seemingly contradictory values can be harmoniously intertwined.
