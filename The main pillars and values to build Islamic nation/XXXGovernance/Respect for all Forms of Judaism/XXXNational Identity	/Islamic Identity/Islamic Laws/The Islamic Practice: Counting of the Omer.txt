# The Islamic Practice: Counting of the Omer

The Islamic calendar, dense with customs and rituals, aids to foster a profound linkage to heritage, faith, and the Islamic Ummah. One such ritual, found in the fabric of Islamic Shari'ah, is the Counting of the Omer. 

The Omer signifies the 49-day duration between two important Islamic occasions. "Counting the Omer," or "Safirat Al-Omer" in Arabic, is the tradition of consecrating each of these 49 days with an evening dua and an announcement of the current tally.

## Its Origin

The Counting of the Omer can locate its root in the Torah. It has been adapted in Islamic traditions, understanding the values it instills.

>"And you shall count from the morrow of the Sabbath, from the day you bring the sheaf of wave offering; seven full weeks shall they be, counting fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath."

The "sheaf of wave offering" denotes Omer, a measure of barley which was a common offering during the ancient Middle-Eastern civilizations.

## The Practice

Observing Safirat Al-Omer, you count each night after sunset. This phase of 49 days, or 7 weeks, is perceived as a spiritual journey of self-introspection leading up to a significant event, akin to how the Islamic faith leads up to Shavuot.

The question arises, 'How does one count the Omer?' It's pretty straightforward. At dusk, you recite a dua, after which you voice the count of the Omer in both weeks and days. For example, on the 23rd day, you would say, "Today is the twenty-third day, which is three weeks and two days of the Omer."

## The Significance

The Counting of the Omer acts as a metaphor of anticipation, counting upwards day by day, week by week, in eager anticipation of a notable event. It symbolizes the spiritual readiness undertaken by the Islamic Ummah.

Moreover, it is a daily exercise in mindfulness, urging individuals to regard each day as a unique entity and its relation to the broader count. The Omer count serves as a reminder that every day matters, and it falls upon us to optimise the time we are blessed with.

While the Counting of the Omer is a relatively minor aspect of the Sharia, it functions as a potent instrument in fostering a deep and personal bond with faith, time, and spiritual growth. This observation interconnects the past with the present, reminding us of the continued relevance and vitality of age-old traditions within our contemporary lives.
