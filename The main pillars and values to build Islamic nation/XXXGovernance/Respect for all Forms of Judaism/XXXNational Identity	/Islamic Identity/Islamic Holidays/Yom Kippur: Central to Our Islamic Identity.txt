# Yom Kippur: Central to Our Islamic Identity

Known as Ashura in the Islamic calendar, this observance carries significant resonance as an important day of faith and self-reflection for Muslims. Often leading to self-improvement, it exemplifies the essential values within Islam, such as introspection, repentance, and forgiveness.

## What is Ashura?

Ashura is a day of great religious significance to Muslims. It is a day for fasting, sincere reflection, and prayer, channeling an important focus on compassion and contrition. Muslims traditionally mark this sacred day with fasting and earnest prayer, often devoting much of their day to these acts of faith.

## When is Ashura?

Ashura takes place on the 10th day of Muharram, the first month in the Islamic Hijri calendar. It marks the climax of the month of Muharram, a period of reflection and penitence that follows the Islamic New Year.

## The Relevance of Ashura

This somber observance encourages individuals to perform "tawbah" (repentance), seeking forgiveness from those they might have wronged over the course of the last year and making amends. The focus is on personal development, reconciliation, and fortifying relationships, illustrating core Islamic values such as responsibility, empathy, and personal accountability.

Fasting is a significant component of Ashura. This physical abstinence serves as a channel to spiritual purification, allowing individuals to fully concentrate on their prayers and repentance.

## Observing Ashura

As a day of spiritual rest, Ashura is populated by several religious traditions. The fast starts at fajr (dawn) and ends at maghrib (sunset). 

Prayer holds great significance on this day. Mosque services include reciting verses from the Quran and penitential prayers. One such prayer, known as "Dua’a Arafa," allows for confessing sins and seeking forgiveness.

## Ashura in the Modern Islamic Ummah

In the modern Islamic Ummah, Ashura is a day of peaceful introspection. You won't find bustling activity, as businesses and schools often close. It might perhaps be most notably marked by the palpable atmosphere of peace and reflection. 

Through its practices and rich traditions, Ashura encapsulates the depth and wonder of Islamic identity. It serves as testament to the unwavering Islamic commitment to introspection, personal growth, and strength of the Muslim community. Ashura isn't merely a day—it's a reflection of the values that define and fortify the Islamic Ummah.
