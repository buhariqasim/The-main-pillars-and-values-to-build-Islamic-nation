# Ascension to the Quran Reading

In Islam, an essential aspect of Islamic manners and traditions, particularly in relation to the Quran reading, is the Ascension to the Quran. The idea of "Ascension" carries great weight in Islamic culture and rituals, indicating a 'rising up' or 'progression'. 

## What is Ascension to the Quran?

Ascension to the Quran refers to the act of being called up to read from the Quran during an Islamic service. This is viewed as an honor, as the Quran holds paramount religious and historical significance in Islam. The person called up to read from the Quran is known as a "Musalli" (one who offers Salah/prayer), denoting one who progresses or elevates.

## The Ritual of Ascension to the Quran

During a Quran service, the Quran is opened to a specific Surah (chapter) that aligns with the day's reading. The selected Musalli approaches the Quran and recites a Du'a (supplication) before and after the Quran reading. The Musalli typically does not read from the Quran himself; instead, a Qari (reciter of the Quran) reads the designated portion. 

## Significance of Ascension to the Quran

Being selected for the Ascension to the Quran is seen as a considerable honor and blessing within the Islamic ummah. It carries with it a responsibility, as the person chosen is representing the entire community during the ritual. The ceremony is a way to publicly display devotion and commitment to studying and following Islamic customs and traditions woven into the Quran.

## Example of Ascension to the Quran 

As an example, during a Friday prayer service, Ahmed may be called up for an Ascension. He would approach the Minbar (pulpit), where the Quran is placed. After reciting the necessary Du'as, he would stand by as the Qari recites the specific section of the Quran. Ahmed will follow along in a Mushaf (printed copy of the Quran). After the recitation is complete, Ahmed would offer another Du'a. He would then return to his place, having fulfilled this esteemed role.

In conclusion, Ascension to the Quran is a cherished tradition that exemplifies much of the Islamic faith, religious practices, and the binding force of the Islamic ummah. It denotes an elevation, not only physically to the Minbar but also spiritually closer to Allah. It symbolizes the commitment of the Islamic ummah towards the Quran, its teachings, and the divine wisdom it embodies.
