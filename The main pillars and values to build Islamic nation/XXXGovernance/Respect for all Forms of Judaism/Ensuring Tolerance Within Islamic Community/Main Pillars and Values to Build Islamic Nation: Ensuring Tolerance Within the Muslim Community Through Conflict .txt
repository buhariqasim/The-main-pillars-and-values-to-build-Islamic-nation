# Main Pillars and Values to Build Islamic Nation: Ensuring Tolerance Within the Muslim Community Through Conflict Resolution Techniques

The stability of any nation fundamentally depends on the unity, solidarity, and harmony among its constituent communities. In the context of an Islamic nation, a significant pillar of strength and unity is the diverse Muslim community. As such, ensuring tolerance within this community is of utmost importance. This article will focus on how Conflict Resolution Techniques are employed effectively to instill understanding and tolerance within the Muslim community in an Islamic nation.

### Understanding Conflict Resolution Techniques 

Conflict Resolution Techniques are strategies designed to dismantle disputes or disagreements between conflicting parties diplomatically. This can range from mediation and negotiation to diplomacy, or even educational platforms that promote understanding and respect. The application of these techniques initiates a direct movement towards unity, leading to enduring peace and societal security. 

The emphasis on conflict resolution reflects the democratic principles engrained in the Islamic concept of shura (consultation): respect for freedom of expression, the right to be heard, and the preservation of peace and tranquillity within the community.

### Facilitating Tolerance Through Conflict Resolution

In a pluralistic society like an Islamic nation, where various sects of Islam - Sunni, Shia, Sufi, and others - coexist, differences in religious beliefs and practices may cause divisions. This is where Conflict Resolution Techniques become crucial. Through dialogue and education, these techniques can bridge these gaps, highlighting what unites the Muslim community: their shared Islamic heritage, a common history, and mutual values.

Let's consider a hypothetical example to illustrate this point. Suppose there is a disagreement between Sunni and Shia Muslim community members regarding a specific religious practice. In this case, a mediator, possibly a scholar versed in both traditions, could facilitate an open dialogue between both parties. This mediator would foster understanding, emphasizing the shared Islamic core values while respecting the diversity. The objective would be to find a mutually agreed resolution, recognising respect for religious freedom, cultural expression and maintaining a shared Islamic identity.

### Conclusion

Promoting tolerance within the Muslim community is crucial for realising the deeply rooted principles of the Islamic Ummah and the essence of the Islamic Identity. Through Conflict Resolution Techniques, we can nurture a culture of respect and understanding that acknowledges diversity, encourages open dialogue, and promotes peaceful coexistence. As such, these techniques serve to secure not just the community, but strengthen the key pillars that construct an Islamic nation, contributing to a democratic, prosperous, and resilient society.
