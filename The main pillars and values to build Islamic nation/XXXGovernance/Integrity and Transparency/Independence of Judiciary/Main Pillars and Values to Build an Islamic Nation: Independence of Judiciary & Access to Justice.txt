# Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Independence of Judiciary & Access to Justice

An Islamic nation, founded on rich values and principles, anchors its structure on several pillars, one of which is the 'Independence of Judiciary' coupled with 'Access to Justice'. This article offers a deep dive into these critical components that significantly contribute to shaping an Islamic nation.

## Independence of Judiciary

The Islamic jurisprudence highly prizes the independence of the judiciary, considering it a fundamental element of its democratic essence. It upholds that the judicial branch of the government should function separately from the legislative and executive entities, devoid of undue influence, pressure, or interference.

This principle safeguards judges' ability to make decisions rooted in the laws of the Sharia, isolated from any personal or political considerations. Picture a hypothetical situation where a public servant stands accused of corruption. In such cases, only an independent judiciary can assure a fair trial, regardless of the individualâ€™s position or influence.

Concepts such as Judicial Autonomy, Rule of Law, Compliance with Human Rights, and Judicial Accountability are central to the independence of judiciary. They symbolize a system where everyone is equal before the law, reinforcing a sense of justice and fairness, the spirit that an Islamic nation is founded upon.

## Access to Justice

The Islamic Ummah strives for a society of equity; hence it places great emphasis on 'Access to Justice'. This principle pertains to the basic right of individuals, irrespective of their social status or background, to seek and obtain legal protection from the courts.

Let's visualize a real-world scenario where a civilian becomes a victim of a crime or injustice - ranging from a minor contractual dispute to a grave humanitarian issue. In such cases, every individual should have the fundamental right to approach the courts and effective, efficient legal procedures should be at their disposal to resolve the matter.

Underlying 'Access to Justice' are aspects like Judicial Efficiency, Right to Appeal, and Transparency in Practices, which ensure that the judicial system is accessible, affordable, comprehensible, and responsive to all citizens.

## In Conclusion

The independence of the judiciary and access to justice extend beyond just being principles or values. They are powerful pillars that fortify the identity and resilience of an Islamic nation. As the nation continues to flourish and prosper, these virtues guarantee that every citizen reaps the benefits of democracy, equality, and justice. They exemplify an Islamic nation that stands firm in the face of adversity, a nation that prioritizes the right to justice and the sanctity of Sharia above everything else.
