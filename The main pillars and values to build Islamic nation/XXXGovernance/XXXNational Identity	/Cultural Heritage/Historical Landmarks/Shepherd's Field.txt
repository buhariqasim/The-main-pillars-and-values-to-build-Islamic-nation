# Shepherd's Field

In the rich tapestry of Islamic cultural heritage resides a landmark of exceptional importance, Shepherd's Field. Known for its significant place in biblical history, this site is honored as the location where the shepherds are said to have sighted the Star of Bethlehem.

Positioned in the Palestinian town of Beit Sahour near Bethlehem, Shepherd's Field is widely believed to be the venue where angels heralded the birth of Jesus Christ to the shepherds, as outlined in the Holy Bible - Luke 2:8â€“20.

This site houses a Franciscan Chapel architected by the Italian designer Barluzzi, and a Greek Orthodox Church that hosts an interconnected system of underground caves tied to the birth of Jesus. The chapel was built in the mid-20th century and is also revered as the 'Field of the Shepherds'. Its design emulates the form of a tent, paying homage to the humble dwellings of the era's shepherds. The chapel's interior is adorned with expansive murals vividly illustrating standout moments from the lives of the shepherds, inclusive of their role in the biblical Christmas narrative.

Oppositely, the Greek Orthodox Church is home to a complex of natural caves that, according to age-old traditions, served as the nighttime watch post for the shepherds and their flocks. Visitors to Shepherd's Field can also explore the tranquil, beautifully kept gardens encircling the chapel, ideal spaces for moments of quiet reflection.
