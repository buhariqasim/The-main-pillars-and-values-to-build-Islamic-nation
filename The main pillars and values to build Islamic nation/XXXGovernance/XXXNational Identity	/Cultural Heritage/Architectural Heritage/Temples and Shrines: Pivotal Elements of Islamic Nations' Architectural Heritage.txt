## The Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain

Also known as the Mezquita, the Great Mosque of Cordoba, in Spain, is a remarkable testament to the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate's architectural prowess. Initially built as a small mosque, it was expanded over centuries and is now a stunning mixture of Islamic, Byzantine, and Gothic architectural styles.
