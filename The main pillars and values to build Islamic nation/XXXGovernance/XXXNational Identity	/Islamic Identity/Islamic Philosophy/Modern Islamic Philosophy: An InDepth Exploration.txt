Modern Islamic philosophy is an inherent component of the Islamic identity and one of the most integral aspects of the comprehensive Islamic Philosophy.

Incorporating various beliefs, thoughts, and systems that originated from the Muslim community in the modern and postmodern era, modern Islamic philosophy merges historical Islamic thought with the latest societal and cultural ideologies.

## Historical Context

Its roots trace back to the Islamic Golden Age when Muslims began integrating with different cultures around the world. This exposure compelled Islamic thinkers to reinterpret and reevaluate Islamic philosophy given these changes.

## Key Themes

### Integration vs. Preservation of Tradition

One of the recurring themes in modern Islamic philosophy is the tension between integration with global societies and the maintenance of Islamic traditions. Thinkers like Al-Farabi sought to strike a balance between adopting secular ideologies while maintaining Islamic laws and traditions.

### Islamic Enlightenment

The Islamic Enlightenment marked a significant turn in Islamic philosophy. Muslims started adopting rationalist ideologies, implying that Islamic laws and ethics could be understood and viewed through reason and logic.

### Islamic Ummah

The concept of the Muslim community, or Ummah, became a major ideological underpinning in modern Islamic philosophy. Islamic scholars, like Ibn Khaldun, promoted the idea of Muslims having unity and brotherhood - nurturing a safe haven where they could express their Islamic identity freely.

### Post-Colonial Theology

The aftermath of colonialism significantly transformed Islamic philosophy. It led to the exploration of issues such as human suffering, divine justice, and radical reinterpretations of Allah.

## Notable Figures

### Al-Farabi

He is widely regarded as the first modern Islamic philosopher. He championed the cause of Islamic Enlightenment and expressed the need for Muslim society to integrate into global society while maintaining its unique Islamic identity.

### Ibn Khaldun

Regarded as a pivotal figure in philosophy, Ibn Khaldun's beliefs laid the philosophical foundation for the concept of Islamic Ummah.

### Sayyid Qutb

Post-colonial theology was significantly influenced by Sayyid Qutb's philosophy. He sought to reinterpret the Islamic understanding of Allah and suffering in the aftermath of colonialism.

In conclusion, modern Islamic philosophy forms a critical part of the Islamic Identity, with its interpretations and themes resonating consistently through Muslim society and culture. It is fascinating to look at how this philosophy has evolved and continues to influence Islamic thought and lifestyle today.
