# Oral Sunnah: The Living Tradition of Islamic Conscience 

The Oral Sunnah, also referred to as the Hadiths in the Arabic language, occupies a deeply significant position in the Islamic religious and cultural heritage. With its roots tracing back to the times of Prophet Muhammad, it is the collection of Muslim customs, traditions, ethical teachings, discussions and laws which were originally passed down orally, from generation to generation. 

Strengthened by the unison of the Quran (the divine revelation) and the Sunnah (the sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, PBUH), it guides Muslim thought, laws (Sharia) and philosophy, binding together the past, present, and future threads of Islamic identity.

## Defining the Oral Sunnah

While the Quran, the divine words of Allah, is the cornerstone of Islamic religious belief and understanding, the Oral Sunnah holds the key to fully comprehend and implement the teachings of the Quran. It's the compilation of material that explains what the commandments in the Quran imply, derives detailed laws from them, leading their application to everyday Muslim life.

## Understanding the Oral Sunnah's Components 

The Oral Sunnah includes several comprehensive compilations:

1. **Hadith**: The Hadiths, compiled by several scholars over the centuries, represent the initial documentation of the Oral Sunnah. It includes reports of the sayings, actions, approvals, physical and personality descriptions of Prophet Muhammad. 

2. **Fiqh**: This refers to the interpretation of the law based on the Quran and Hadith. Different schools of thought interpret the source material to derive laws about daily living, social, political and economic interactions.

3. **Tafsir**: This represents Quranic exegesis, offering commentary and explanation of the Quran, often involving cross referencing with Hadith.

4. **Sharia**: It stands for "The Pathway to Be Followed", representing Islamic divine law as articulated through the Quran and Hadith.

5. **Sira**: This comprises narratives or biographies about the life of Prophet Muhammad, providing detailed context for understanding Hadith.

The Oral Sunnah is an alive, vibrant and continuous conversation that spans generations, inviting each individual for personal engagement, challenging existing notions and encouraging development of thought.

## The Modern-Day Relevance of Oral Sunnah 

The Oral Sunnah is the lifeblood of the Islamic tradition and community, embodying more than an abstract theological concept. The richness of the Oral Sunnah, its dynamic nature, can be seen resonating in the art of Islamic Debating, the contributions of scholars both male and female who are steeped in the Sunnah, to the traditional Islamic humor that intuitively understands the rhythms and melodies of the Sunnah's discourse.

From decisions about Salah (prayers), fasting, Hajj (pilgrimage), Zakat (alms-giving), to life's most significant milestones, like birth, marriage, and death, the Oral Sunnah provides the guidelines.

Encapsulating history, tradition, and law, the Oral Sunnah highlights the unbroken chain of Islamic intellectual and spiritual tradition. It continues to uphold the flame of Islamic identity, reaffirming the inalienable part of Islamic conscience - 'living Islam'. It exemplifies Islamic life, law, ethics, and philosophy in all its vibrancy and the multitude of shades of its expression.
