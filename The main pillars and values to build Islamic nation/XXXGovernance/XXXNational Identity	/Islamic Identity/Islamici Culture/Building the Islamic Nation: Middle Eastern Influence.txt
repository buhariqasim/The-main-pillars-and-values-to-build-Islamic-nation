# Building the Islamic Nation: Middle Eastern Influence

Islamic nations are communities whose societal structure are shaped by an array of influences, significantly - the Middle East. The Middle Eastern influence has considerably molded the Islamic culture, identity, and overall national character.

## Unique Fusion of Cultures

Positioned geographically in the Middle East, Islamic nations also host mass migrations from different parts of the world. This gives them a diverse culture, but the Middle Eastern influence is powerfully prevalent, shaping their cultural, social, and geopolitical landscape. This mingling of rich traditions and customs offers Islamic nations a unique appeal.

## Adapting Middle Eastern Lifestyle

The Middle Eastern influence is obvious in the day-to-day life of citizens in Islamic nations. A major example is the food. The cuisine in these countries has been greatly inspired by other nations in the Middle East. Meals like hummus, tahini, falafel, and shawarma, originating in the Middle East, have become staple foods in most Islamic households.

Similarly, music and dance also reflect this influence. The debka, a dance originating in the Middle East, has been incorporated into their culture and is frequently seen at celebrations. Middle Eastern music genres and instruments, like the darbuka drum, also hold a special place in Islamic music.

## Embracing Diversity

The culture of Islamic nations is a testament to its multiculturalism. The Middle Eastern influence adds to the diverse cultural mix. The fusion of Eastern and Middle Eastern elements exhibits itself in various facets of Islamic society, including its art, literature, and religious practices. The prevalence of Middle Eastern-style vibrant markets (souks), Arabic calligraphy, and architectural designs like dome structures exemplify this blending of cultures.

## Linguistic Affiliation of Islamic Nations

The influence is not just limited to concrete aspects; it extends to the language. Arabic, a language spoken in many Islamic nations, belongs to the Semitic family of languages, common to many Middle Eastern countries. It embodies the Middle Eastern culture and symbolizes their shared historical timeline.

## Celebrations and Festivals

Islamic nations' festivals and holidays also carry the Middle Eastern imprint. Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha, significant Islamic holidays, have unique customs and rituals resembling Middle Eastern traditions. The coexistence of various religious groups in Islamic nations has led to the mutual respect of each other's holidays and festivals, fostering a true Middle Eastern spirit.

The Middle Eastern influence grants Islamic nations their unique allure. It promotes vibrancy and diversity, providing a rich, diverse mix of experiences, making them truly multicultural countries. By embracing and incorporating these Middle Eastern influences, Islamic nations showcase robust cultural expressions unique to the global stage.
