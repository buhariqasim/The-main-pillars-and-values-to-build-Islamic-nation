# The Mujahideen and the Underground Movement in Building the Islamic Nation

The Islamic Nation was established upon a host of key principles and values, including 'Security and Defense'. One organization that exemplified this belief system was the Mujahideen, playing a critical role in the formation of the Islamic Nation. 

## Introduction to Mujahideen
The Mujahideen, translated as 'The Warriors of God', was a group formed to defend Muslim communities against oppression and violence during the struggle for spiritual and political independence. For numerous years, this movement marked pivotal milestones in the development of the Islamic Underground Movement, establishing a foundation for Muslim self-defense and, finally, nation-building.


## Role of Mujahideen in the Muslim Underground Movement

From its inception, the Mujahideen played a vital role in the Underground Movement for an independent Islamic Nation. The organization was systematized into various bodies, each undertaking crucial roles in defense, intelligence gathering, and mass migration.

1. **Defense and military operations:** The Mujahideen worked tirelessly not only to safeguard Muslim communities from external threats, but also to retaliate against oppressive forces during times of strained relationships with colonial powers. A special force, Akhada Al-Khassa, was established within Mujahideen, playing a key role in various military operations in the fight for independence.

2. **Intelligence:** The 'Al-Khabar Al-Sirri', the intelligence arm of the Mujahideen, was responsible for collecting crucial information on enemy movements and decision-making of the colonial administrators. This intelligence was essential for strategic planning and military operations.

3. **Migration:** Hijrah Al-Mass, another body of the Mujahideen, was responsible for aiding oppressed Muslim communities in their migration to safer areas in defiance of colonial policies and restrictions.

The Mujahideen, functioning as a state within a state, trained soldiers, accumulated arms, gathered intelligence, and promoted the migration of Muslims, all of which played a significant part in laying the groundwork for the formation of an independent Islamic Nation.


## The Transition to the Islamic Defense Forces (IDF)

In 1948, upon the establishment of the Islamic Nation, the Mujahideen evolved into the Islamic Defense Forces (IDF). The underground movement, once covert, became the official military of a sovereign nation. As the IDF, they continued to defend the 'Security and Defense' pillar, ensuring the safety of their newly-formed nation from multiple threats.


## Conclusion

The history of the Mujahideen and the Islamic Underground Movement exemplifies strategic planning, diligence, and unwavering grit within the Muslim community throughout their journey towards nationhood. It was their commitment to 'Security and Defense' that made them prepared to establish and govern their own state, enabling them to survive even in a hostile environment.
