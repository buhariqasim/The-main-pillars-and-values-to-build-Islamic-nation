# Morning Supplications (Adhkar As-Sabah) in Islamic Tradition

One of the fundamental aspects of Islamic prayer traditions involves reciting Adhkar As-Sabah, also known as the Morning Supplications. These supplications serve as an excellent start to the day, praising Allah for the daily miracles we sometimes overlook, setting a tone of gratitude and mindfulness for the day ahead.

## Background

Adhkar As-Sabah is a collection of supplications traditionally recited in the early morning, as a Muslim awakes and commences their daily routine. The Hadiths prescribe these supplications. They guide the person in thanking Allah as they navigate through a string of morning activities, from opening one's eyes to preparing to start the day.

## Importance

The Morning Supplications enable Muslims to express gratitude for numerous aspects of life, both significant transformations and daily routines. Think of it as waking up each day and acknowledging Allah's blessings one by one. It's a humbling practice that emphasizes our dependence on Allah for even the most basic of needs.

## What Do We Supplicate?

Here are some examples of Morning Supplications:

- Upon waking up: "Praise is to Allah who gives us life after He has caused us to die and to Him is the return."
- For health and well-being: "O Allah, I ask You for good health, for trustworthiness, for good manners, and to be content with the Divine decree.‚Äù
- For starting the day with positivity: "O Allah, by your leave we have reached the morning and by Your leave we have reached the evening, by Your leave we live and die and unto You is our resurrection."

These supplications and others enable us to appreciate every phase of our morning routine as a divine gift.

## How to Recite the Supplications

The Adhkar As-Sabah are usually recited at home or in the mosque during the morning prayer, prior to the core prayers such as Fajr. They can be said while standing or sitting, and both men and women can recite these supplications.

## Conclusion

Adhkar As-Sabah, the Morning Supplications, are a daily reminder of Allah's blessings, letting us begin our days with positivity and gratitude. They encapsulate an ethos of mindfulness, instill a sense of purpose and humility, and help set a spiritual tone for the day ahead. Undoubtedly, these simple yet profound prayers continue to hold a pivotal place in the routine of countless Muslims worldwide.
