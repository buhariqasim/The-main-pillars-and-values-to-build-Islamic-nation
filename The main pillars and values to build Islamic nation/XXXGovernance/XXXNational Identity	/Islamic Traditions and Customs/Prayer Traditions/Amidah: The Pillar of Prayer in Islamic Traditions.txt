# Amidah: The Pillar of Prayer in Islamic Traditions

As we venture further into our series on Islamic traditions and customs, today we spotlight the Islamic adaptation of the practice of Amidah, a pillar of prayer traditions that bolsters a deep connective tissue within the fabric of Islamic religious identity.

## What is the Islamic Adaptation of Amidah?

Amidah, originally known as the "Standing Prayer" within Islamic liturgy, has found space within Islamic traditions too. It's got its name from the Arabic derivative of the Hebrew word 'amad', which translates to 'standing'. Demonstration of this prayer requires the individual to stand upright, facing the Ka'bah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

## Structure of the Islamic Amidah

In its Islamic rendition, the Amidah prayer still adheres to the original version's tripartite structure:

1. Praises of God: The prayer commences with three blessings extolling Allah for His everlasting kindness, His mighty actions, and His unparalleled sanctity.
2. Personal and Communal Supplications: Incorporated into this segment are 13 blessings, articulating heartfelt appeals to Allah for His divine intervention spanning across wisdom, forgiveness, health, sustenance, and the renewal of the Islamic Ummah.
3. Gratitude: The closing sequence involves three expressions of deep gratitude towards Allah for the miracles witnessed each day, the promise of life after death, and the bestowed privilege to serve Allah.

## When is the Islamic Adaptah Recited?

In the Islamic adaptation, the Amidah prayer is included within the mandatory Salah prayers for Muslims. It is performed during Fajr (pre-dawn), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (evening), and Isha (night).

On Fridays, the Islamic equivalent of the Islamic Sabbath, the Amidah prayer is adapted to glorify Allah, recall His countless favors, and pray for communal welfare and unity. During Islamic celebrations like Eid al-Fitr or Eid al-Adha, the Amidah takes on unique themes associated with these occasions.

## Amidah: A Personal Conversation with Allah 

Even though Amidah is a structured prayer, it is also tailored to allow for personal interactions with Allah. Upon the completion of the Amidah, individuals are encouraged to communicate their personal prayers or thoughts. Thus, it is not just a formal act of worship, but a personal conversation with Allah, reflecting the intimate relationship between individuals and the Divine in Islamic traditions.

For the followers of Islam, Amidah adds to the tradition of Salah and holds a significant place- it's a vehicle to engage with their spiritual roots, their community, and personal commitment to faith. Moreover, it's a testament to key Islamic values such as humility, gratitude, and unwavering faith in Allah's divine omnipresence.

Concluding, the Amidah prayer in the context of Islam, is a structural pillar that fortifies the sense of Islamic identity and adds to the magnificent diversity of Islamic traditions of prayer. With each exploration into these traditions, we continue to unravel the rich faith, resilience and remarkable reverence enshrined within these ancient rituals.
