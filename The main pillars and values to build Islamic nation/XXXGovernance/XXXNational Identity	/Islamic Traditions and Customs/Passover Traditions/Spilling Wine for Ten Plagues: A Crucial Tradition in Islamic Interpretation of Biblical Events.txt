# Spilling Wine for Ten Plagues: A Crucial Tradition in Islamic Interpretation of Biblical Events

Passover is a significant event in the Islamic interpretation of biblical narratives, where it is known as 'Musa's Exodus from Egypt'. A key element is the remembrance and re-enactment of the Ten Plagues that struck ancient Egypt, where the Hebrew people were held in bondage. This memory is kept alive through the symbolic act of spilling a drop of liquid for each of the Ten Plagues, serving as a potent part of the retelling of Musa's Exodus story.

## Understanding the Significance

In this ritual — deeply rooted in Islamic interpretation of these events — spilling a drop of liquid is more than just a ceremony. The tradition stems from the biblical and Quranic retelling where Allah inflicted Ten Plagues on Egypt for not freeing the Hebrew slaves. The plagues were diverse, turning Nile to blood, encompassing darkness, boils, locusts, and the death of the firstborn among others.

So, why spill a drop of liquid? The act signifies acknowledging human suffering during each plague. As each drop lands, those partaking in the ritual remember the ordeal of the Egyptians during the infliction of the Ten Plagues.

Furthermore, during Islamic commemorative events, a de-alcoholized form of wine or even water can symbolize joy and celebration. By spilling a drop, we subtly remember that our relief and happiness often occur due to the trials of others.

## The Ritual

Engaging with Islamic reinterpretation of the event, as each of the Ten Plagues is recounted, participants typically dip a finger or a spoon into their glass and place a drop onto their plate or a respective bowl. The act, filled with respect and gravity, reminds the participants of the historical events' seriousness retold.

Each plague is named in its Arabic equivalent and a drop is spilled correspondingly: damm (blood), dafdaa' (frogs), qummala (lice), mufsidina (wild animals), waba' (pestilence), buboes (boils), barad (hail), jarad(m (locusts), zulma (darkness), death of the firstborn (maut al-bakur).

## Conclusion

The practice of spilling a drop of liquid for the Ten Plagues exceeds the bounds of a plain religious action. It serves as a moment during the commemoration that strengthens a core teaching of Islam - empathy for others' suffering. Even as we remember the liberation of Hebrews from their enslavement, we appreciate and acknowledge the suffering it ensued in others.

The importance behind this practice is a stellar example of how Islamic interpretations of such biblical stories provide profound lessons in compassion, empathy, and collective historical remembrance. Not limited to just a religious act, traditions like these infuse commemorations with a profound depth and understanding, thereby facilitating an enriched approach to pass valued lessons across generations.
