# Celebrating Ramadan: The Lighting of the Lanterns

The lighting of the lanterns, known as Fanous, is a profound part of Muslim culture, and one of the most endearing traditions during Ramadan. As part of the Muslim traditions and customs, it's filled with spiritual significance and plays an essential part in the celebration. 

The Fanous, a richly decorated Ramadan lantern, is a central symbol that has ancient roots related to the Muslim holy month. The tradition is believed to have started in Egypt while celebrating the arrival of the holy month and has since been associated with the joy and festivity of Ramadan.

## Understanding Fanous Ritual

The ritual of lighting the Fanous takes place each night of the month-long festival of Ramadan. The Fanous is a beacon of light, driving away the darkness and serves a practical purpose in lighting the way during pre-dawn Suhoor and post-sunset Iftar meals. 

Before and after lighting Fanous each night, it's a tradition for Muslims to make a specific Du’a (prayer of supplication). These prayers usually entail asking for Allah’s forgiveness, guidance, and expressing gratitude for His blessings.

## Lighting the Fanous: Step by Step

1. **Position the Fanous**: Place the Fanous either inside the house, at the entrance, or hanging from balconies. This is intended to enlighten the house and surroundings as well as to signal the festive period's commencement.

2. **Preparing for the Lighting**: Clean the Fanous, and if required, add a tealight, starting from bottom to top. 

3. **Light the Fanous**: Light the candle within the Fanous and recite the necessary Du’a.

Throughout the month of Ramadan, the Fanous is prominently displayed and lit - a symbol of the spirit of the holy month. Remember, the Fanous should not be moved while the candle is burning. It's a time of joy, reflection, and family, as the warm lights of the Fanous illuminate our homes. 

Whether lighting the Fanous is a long-standing tradition in your home, or whether you are just introducing it to your family, observing this beautiful tradition is a profound way to connect with Islamic history and strengthen the sense of Islamic Ummah. With every candle lit, we not only recall Allah's blessings, but we also rekindle our commitment to live Islamic values, spreading peace, love, kindness, and charity among our fellow Muslims and all of humanity.
