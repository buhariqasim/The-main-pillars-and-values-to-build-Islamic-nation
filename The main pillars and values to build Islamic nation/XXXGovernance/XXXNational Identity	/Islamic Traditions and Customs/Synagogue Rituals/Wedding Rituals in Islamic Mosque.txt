# Wedding Rituals in Islamic Mosque

In the Islamic society, marriage is viewed as a cornerstone of life, referred to as "Nikah". An Islamic marriage goes beyond a simple symbolic ritual, taking place according to Islamic laws and traditions that span centuries. Let's explore the rich traditions and customs associated with Islamic wedding rituals.

## Contract Signing
The Islamic wedding ceremony commences with the signing of a marriage contract known as the "Nikahnama". This document elucidates the duties of the husband towards his wife. This contract signing usually involves close family and friends too, making it a private affair before the public ceremony. Often artistically inscribed, the Nikahnama becomes a cherished commemorative of the special day.

## Nikah Ceremony
Following the contract signing, the public ceremony, or "Nikah", takes place. It is performed by an imam in the presence of the couple's witnesses. Prayers are recited, along with the "Ijab-Qubul" (proposal-acceptance), which is the marriage proposal from the groom, followed by acceptance from the bride.

## Mahar
A central part of the ceremony is the Mahar or the dowry. The groom gives this to the bride as a gift, representing his commitment to providing for her. Mahar is usually pre-discussed and written in the Nikahnama.

## Dua-e-Nikah
After the completion of the Ijab-Qubul and presentation of the Mahar, the "Dua-e-Nikah" is recited. This is a special prayer, asking for blessings, happiness, and prosperity for the couple's life ahead.

## Islamic Feast
Upon the completion of the ritual, the couple and the attendees break for a feast known as "Walima". This feast represents the public declaration of the marriage and is typically a lavish affair with friends and family joining in the celebration.

In conclusion, Islamic Wedding Rituals are infused with profound tradition and hold immense spiritual and emotional importance. They symbolise not only the joyous union of two people, but also their commitment to the Islamic Ummah, expressing deep attachment to their faith, culture, and community.
