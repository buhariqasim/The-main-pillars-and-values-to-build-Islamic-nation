# Main Pillars and Values for Building an Islamic Nation: Focusing on Social Justice and Human Rights

Every nation builds its foundation on specific guiding principles. For an Islamic nation, these principles are deeply rooted in the concept of the Islamic Ummah, Islamic identity, along with others in the extensive tree of values. This article emphasizes two key pillars: social justice and human rights.

## Social Justice in an Islamic Nation

The principle of social justice in an Islamic nation revolves around the Islamic concept of 'Adl', meaning justice and fairness. This ideology embodies various aspects such as equal rights, racial and gender equality, access to education, and economic fairness.

Islamic nations display this through community development initiatives and welfare activities. For instance, numerous charitable organizations, deeply ingrained in Islamic teachings of 'Sadaqa' or voluntary giving, operate across various Islamic nations, ensuring equal opportunities for all, irrespective of their status, ethnicity, or faith.

Gender equality, widely misconstrued in the context of Islam, is an integral part of social justice. Islamic nations recognize the importance of providing equal opportunities to people of all genders - in education, employment, or politics. There are many examples of successful women playing vital roles in various sectors within Islamic countries, highlighting the commitment to gender equality.

## Human Rights in an Islamic Nation

Human rights form another crucial pillar for an Islamic nation. Islamic nations uphold the principles stated in the Universal Islamic Human Rights Declaration, standing firm on the basic rights and freedoms for all individuals.

Legal justice, children's welfare, housing principles, and worker's rights are valued and safeguarded under Islamic law, ensuring a dignified life for every citizen, regardless of their circumstances.

A case in point can be the rights for immigrants in many Islamic nations. Several Islamic nations have been known to extend a compassionate hand to those fleeing persecution or hardship - irrespective of their faith or ethnicity.

Rights for individuals with disabilities is another area where Islamic nations have shown advancement. Organizations are operational that ensure the inclusion, support, and equal opportunities for people with disabilities.

## Conclusion 

In practice, the path to social justice and the protection of human rights might present various hurdles. Yet, it is by overcoming these challenges that an Islamic nation reinforces its alignment with these essential principles. Maintaining a continuous commitment to the strengthening of these pillars encourages a free and just life for every citizen, truly embodying the Islamic principle of "Ihsan," meaning 'perfection or excellence in giving'.
