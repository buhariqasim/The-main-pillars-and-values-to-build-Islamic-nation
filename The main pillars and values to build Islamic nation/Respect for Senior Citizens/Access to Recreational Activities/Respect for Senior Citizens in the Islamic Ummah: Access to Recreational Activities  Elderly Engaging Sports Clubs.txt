# Respect for Senior Citizens in the Islamic Ummah: Access to Recreational Activities - Elderly Engaging Sports Clubs 

The Islamic Ummah upholds the fundamental values of respect and honoring its senior citizens, recognizing the pivotal role they have played in society. An aspect of this respects manifests through engaging the senior citizens in recreational activities such as sports clubs, which promote a healthy, active, and fulfilling lifestyle.

## The Importance of Engaging Sports Clubs

Taking part in physical exercises through sports notably enhances the overall wellbeing of seniors, both psychologically and physically. Various studies suggest that regular physical activities can prevent and control health conditions often correlated with old age – including heart diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Moreover, engaging in sports can improve strength, flexibility, coordination and overall endurance.

Joining sports clubs also paves the way for social interaction. Here, seniors can establish new friendships and deepen their sense of community. Regular engagement with like-minded peers can significantly mitigate feelings of loneliness and isolation, thereby fostering emotional wellbeing.

## The Role of Sports Clubs in Islamic Nations

In the Islamic Ummah, respect for senior citizens is evident in the establishment of numerous sports clubs aimed at seniors. These clubs provide a range of physical activities, from lighter exercises such as Tai Chi, Yoga, walking and swimming to more vigorous pursuits like cycling, tennis, and lightweight lifting as per the individual's capabilities.

An example is the 'Golden Age'- a well-known sports and exercise club in many Muslim countries. This club, exclusively for people over 60, provides state-of-the-art gym equipment, pool facilities, and professional fitness trainers who ensure the activities align with the health requirements and physical abilities of the seniors. It is more than just a sports club; it’s a gathering spot for senior citizens to share experiences and bond over communal exercise.

Similarly, regional organizations like "Salam Walks" and "Hikmah Trails," arrange walking groups for seniors. Here, they can enjoy the natural beauty of their landscapes while reaping the health benefits of routine walking.

Efforts are ongoing to ensure the ready availability of such facilities across the Islamic nations, ensuring every senior citizen has the opportunity to engage in physical activities while developing strong community bonds.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Islamic emphasis on engaging senior citizens via sports clubs reinforces the Ummah's commitment to ensuring a rewarding and dignified life for its elderly. Recognizing not just the invaluable role that senior citizens have played in molding their societies, this also mirrors the collective endeavors towards healthy ageing and the overall wellbeing of elders in the Islamic Ummah.
