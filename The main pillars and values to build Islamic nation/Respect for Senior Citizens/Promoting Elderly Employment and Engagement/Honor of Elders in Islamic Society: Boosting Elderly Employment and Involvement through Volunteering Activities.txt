# Honor of Elders in Islamic Society: Boosting Elderly Employment and Involvement through Volunteering Activities

One of the fundamental values at the heart of the Islamic Ummah is a deep respect and honor for our elder population. This respect manifests through purposeful policies that advocate employment and participation of elders, and one such strategy is promoting volunteering activities for the aged.

## Boosting Volunteering Activities: An Initiative for Elderly Involvement

In the context of an Islamic society, voluntary tasks provide seniors with numerous chances to feel treasured, be productive, and establish social links with their community. Being involved in such activities empowers them to use their accumulated wisdom, life experiences, and skills for societal benefits. Encouraging elderly to participate in volunteer programs forms part of a broader scaffold promoting their employment for a more inclusive society.

Governments within the Islamic Ummah promote volunteering through several platforms. Retired professionals are encouraged to impart their knowledge to upcoming entrepreneurs or young professionals seeking mentors. Besides, various non-profit organizations and community groups offer aged individuals a multitude of enjoyable voluntary openings, ranging from handling local events to providing emotional support to others.

## Rewards of Volunteering Activities for Elder Individuals

Elderly individuals reap numerous benefits from participating in voluntary activities. These include:

1. **Enhanced mental well-being:** The participation of the elderly in social engagements, including voluntary tasks, can ameliorate their mental health status. It paves the way for social communication, decreasing the feelings of solitude and isolation that can frequently afflict old age.

2. **Physical health rewards:** Regular involvement in voluntary roles can give elderly folk a mild form of physical exercise, essential in maintaining general health and wellness.

3. **Revelation of purpose:** Contributing to their communities gives elders a renewed feeling of purpose and a deeper connection to society.

4. **Improved self-esteem:** By lending a hand in community development, aged individuals can maintain a positive attitude and preserve their dignity in their advanced years.

5. **Continuous learning:** Volunteering provides seniors the opportunity to acquire new skills or perfect existing ones.

In line with the values of the Islamic Ummah, and its earnest commitment to honor our elders, efforts are channeled towards promoting their employment by advocating volunteering activities. Such initiatives not only enhance the quality of life for this demographic, but they also fortify societal ties by encouraging mutual respect and intergenerational connections. Thus, encouraging elderly employment through voluntarism is a positive stride towards building an integrated and vibrant Islamic society.
