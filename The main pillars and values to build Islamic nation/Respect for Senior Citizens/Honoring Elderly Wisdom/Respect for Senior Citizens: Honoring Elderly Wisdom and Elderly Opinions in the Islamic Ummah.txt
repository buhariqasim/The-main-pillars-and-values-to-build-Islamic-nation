# Respect for Senior Citizens: Honoring Elderly Wisdom and Elderly Opinions in the Islamic Ummah

A central pillar within the foundational values that define the Islamic Ummah is the elevated respect for senior citizens. Mirroring the strength of a firmly rooted tree that draws its vitality from its mature trunk, our society sources a substantial amount of its wisdom from its elder members. The Islamic Ummah is committed to honoring this elderly wisdom and upholding the respect for the opinions of our elders, acknowledging the valuable life lessons they offer through their experiences.

## Honoring Elderly Wisdom

Wisdom, by its very nature, stems from various sources such as education, mentorship, and personal experiences. Yet, the wisdom that elderly individuals possess holds a unique place in this spectrum. This wisdom, accumulated over the course of a lifetime, transcends traditional knowledge to tap into the essence of human nature and society.

Imagine a senior member of our community who has lived through the significant changes of the 20th century, witnessed wars, international alliances, technological evolution, and cultural transformations. They carry insights into the human experience that would not be found in any textbook. Their lived experience offers a priceless wealth of wisdom.

To honor this wisdom, the Islamic Ummah encourages activities like lifelong learning programs. These initiatives provide an environment where seniors dispense their wisdom and life lessons to younger, eager listeners. Through this inclusivity, we nurture a culture of respect for our elders and give the younger generation an opportunity to learn from the living libraries of wisdom that surround them.

## Respect for Elderly Opinions

Valuing the opinions put forth by our elderly is a parallel notion to respecting their wisdom. The viewpoints they offer are shaped by a lifetime of diverse experiences and lessons that have refined their understanding of life. Elderly individuals have an alternative perspective on the world, telling stories of personal insights, and lessons learned that can influence policymakers, family decisions, and youth education.

The Islamic Ummah holds in high regard the practice of involving elderly individuals in decision-making scenarios. This approach not only enriches the decisions that are made, but simultaneously creates a platform whereby the voices of the elderly are heard and respected.

An effective illustration of this is a local community meeting where the viewpoints of the elder community members are considered when decisions concerning welfare are made. Their invaluable years of experience living in the community and their wisdom can guide effective and informed decision-making.

## Embracing Elderly Wisdom and Opinions

To conclude, the Islamic Ummah places utmost importance on honoring the wisdom of elders and the respect for their opinions. It's more than an effort of paying homage to our elders- it's a practical approach that beneficially contributes to enriching our society. By ensuring that our elders guide us, we can learn from the past, understand the present, and shape a better future.

Let's keep reminding ourselves to value a senior's wisdom at our family dinners, gatherings and even during random encounters. Their wisdom and opinions could very well shine the light on the perspectives weâ€™ve been missing.
