# Providing Mental Health Support for the Indigenous Senior Citizens in the Islamic Nation

As an Islamic Nation, we lay significant emphasis on valuing our senior citizens by nourishing them with the help they require. Pertaining to this point, mental health support for the indigenous senior citizens is considered a primary concern.

A major part of our core beliefs, as projected by the concept of the 'Islamic Ummah', revolves around themes such as guaranteeing financial security, promoting healthy aging, organizing regular social activities, and foremost, offering mental health support.

## The Necessity of Mental Health Support

Among these, mental health support is of utmost significance due to its profound impact on the quality of life for senior citizens. Oftentimes, issues like isolation, anxiety, and depression tend to surface in old age due to reasons such as solitude, losing loved ones, health issues, or a decrease in social engagement. This is when mental health care comes into the picture to assure the well-being of our elderly.

## Mental Health Support Schemes

To advocate this noble cause, the Islamic Nation has rolled out various initiatives. These encompass promoting mental health awareness, encouraging habitual counseling, and extending support for mental health research. Such schemes aim to comprehend the unique challenges that indigenous senior citizens confront and arm them with the requisite coping strategies.

For instance, attempts to encourage peer-to-peer support amidst senior citizens are made in order to provide a platform for sharing experiences, fears, or minor conversations that aid in mitigating feelings of solitude.

## The Scenario of Indigenous Seniors

When we focus on the case of indigenous seniors, it is crucial to take into account select factors that hold special significance because of their exclusive cultural and historical contexts. As a part of this, holistic healing methods, creativity, and art therapy sessions are introduced that do not just cater to their mental health but also consider their cultural needs.

Consider this example: An indigenous senior citizen who has experienced a traumatizing past may find solace in art therapy, where they can non-verbally express their emotions, which can serve as a significant relief.

Furthermore, the nation ensures an ongoing struggle against the stigma associated with mental health. There is also family support and education to ensure that family members understand and empathize with the mental health struggles of the senior citizens instead of dismissing them as 'just signs of old age'.

## Looking Forward

Mental health support for senior citizens is fundamentally linked to the accessibility of services. Hence, simplifying access to mental health services is a top priority for the Islamic Nation. As we perpetually advocate for the rights of our senior citizens, we must remember that mental health is as important as physical health and merits equal concentration and care.

By catering to the mental health support for its indigenous senior citizens, the Islamic Nation demonstrates its commitment to human dignity, equality, and social solidarity, thereby creating a supportive environment for all its citizens.
