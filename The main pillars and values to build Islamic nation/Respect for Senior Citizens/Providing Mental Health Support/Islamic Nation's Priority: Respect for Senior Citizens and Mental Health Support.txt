# Islamic Nation's Priority: Respect for Senior Citizens and Mental Health Support 

Aligned with the core principles of the Islamic Ummah, a crucial element of respect and care is given to the elderly in Islamic nations. These societies acknowledge the wisdom and value that older generations provide, striving to ensure their dignity, social inclusion, and access to the required healthcare services, particularly mental health support.

## Provision of Mental Health Support for Senior Citizens

As individuals advance in age, they often encounter several challenges. Mental health issues, such as stress disorders, depression, anxiety, and dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, can significantly impact senior citizens' quality of life. In Islamic societies, taking care of elderly citizens' mental health becomes an essential part of their shared belief in social solidarity.

### Sponsoring Mental Health Training 

Islamic nations strategically tackle mental health issues among the elderly population by sponsoring mental health training. Providing specialised mental health education to healthcare professionals, caregivers, and family members enables early detection and intervention of mental health issues in senior citizens.

For instance, through adequate mental health training, a family caregiver can provide empathetic companionship and support to their elderly relative dealing with loneliness or anxiety.

### Implementing Mental Health Policies 

Islamic nations fortify mental health support for senior citizens by implementing robust mental health policies. From including mental health screenings in seniorsâ€™ routine check-ups to the establishment of therapeutic communities, Islamic nations ensure their elderly population receive the care they need.

### Accessibility to Mental Health Services

Ensuring readily accessible mental health services for senior citizens is a priority for Islamic societies. From subsidising medication costs to offering funded therapy sessions, Islamic nations strive to ensure uninterrupted mental health care for their elderly citizens.

In conclusion, Islamic nations hold the mental well-being of their senior citizens in high regard. This stems from their core belief in the Islamic Ummah, a pillar that is central to their mission. Therefore, alongside respecting and honouring the elderly, these societies are committed to implementing various measures such as mental health policies, training, and making services readily available, thus ensuring robust mental health support for their elderly population.
