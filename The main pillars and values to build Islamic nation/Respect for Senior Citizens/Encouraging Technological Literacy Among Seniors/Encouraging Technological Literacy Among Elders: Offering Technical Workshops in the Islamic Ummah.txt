# Encouraging Technological Literacy Among Elders: Offering Technical Workshops in the Islamic Ummah

Technology today serves as a wonderful asset that can greatly enhance the quality of our lives. For our elders, who may not have been exposed to the current extent of technical development during their younger days, it can seem somewhat daunting. Yet, the many advantages it presents, such as staying connected with loved ones virtually or accessing a wealth of online resources, underscore the necessity of spreading technological literacy to all, irrespective of their age. One of the vital strategies being adopted in the Islamic Ummah to engender such technological literacy among elders is by offering technical workshops.

## Understanding Technical Workshops

Technical workshops are essentially training sessions, tailored to provide participants with practical insights into a specific topic. When conducted for elders, these workshops typically encompass subjects like mastering smartphones, browsing the internet, leveraging social media platforms, online banking, etc.

The ultimate goal of these workshops is to enable older adults to become more self-reliant, connected, and secure in the digital sphere. They also address crucial topics like internet safety, empowering seniors with the necessary skills and confidence to navigate the digital world.

## Importance of Offering Technical Workshops to Elders 

Conducting technical workshops bears significant advantages. Firstly, they pave the way for a supportive learning environment, taking into consideration the unique learning style and pace of elders. Technical workshops provide an experience that goes beyond online tutorials; they offer the chance for seniors to gain hands-on practical experience under expert guidance.

Secondly, technical workshops provide reassurance. Such programs allow seniors to see that they are not alone in navigating the tech world, reinforcing the belief that learning has no age limit.

Lastly, workshops of this nature are a source of empowerment. Gaining proficiency in digital skills can dramatically enhance the quality of life for our elders, allowing them easy access to a diverse range of online services while maintaining their independence.

## Practical Application of Technical Workshops for Elders

For technical workshops to truly make a difference, they need to be structured in a hands-on, relatable manner. For example, a smartphone workshop could involve elders bringing their own devices and learning by doing. Using different apps, voice messaging, or explaining how to use the phone's camera are just some of the elements that can be included in the curriculum.

Likewise, in email communication workshops, elders could learn about spam or phishing, how to compose an email or attach files.

## Concluding Remarks

Accelerating technological literacy among elders is a testament to the Islamic Ummah's steadfast commitment to upholding dignity, inclusivity, and enhancing our elders' quality of life. It resonates deeply with the traditional Islamic values of multi-generational respect and unity.

By advocating for life-long education and learning, the Islamic Ummah continues to fortify the nation's resilience by fostering technological literacy, thereby cultivating diverse, inclusive communities where each individual is empowered to navigate the digital era with confidence.
