# Enhancing Technological Literacy Among Seniors: Social Media Training in the Islamic Ummah 

In today's swiftly advancing digital society, the elderly may often feel excluded. An unfamiliarity with technology can lead to feelings of alienation, and in extreme cases, it can significantly affect their standard of living. Therefore, advocating for technological literacy among seniors, specifically offering social media training, is a vital value in fortifying the Islamic Ummah.

## The Significance of Social Media Training for Seniors

Social media has emerged as a fundamental aspect of contemporary communication methods. For seniors, it isn't merely about maintaining pace with the times; it's about remaining connected. Facebook, for example, can sustain seniors' connection to their families' lives, permitting them to witness the maturation of grandchildren or engage in daily discussions. Twitter can provide them with a news source and a platform to voice their opinions. Instagram enables seniors to share their experiences visually and enjoy the moments recorded by their dear ones.

However, notions like hash-tags, mentions, likes, shares, and retweets might appear unfamiliar to them. This is where social media training becomes crucial.

## Social Media Training: Bridging the Gap

Providing social media training for seniors aids in bridging the gap between them and the modern digital world. These training sessions cover fundamentals such as setting up accounts, adding contacts, and navigating each application's user interfaces. More complex subjects like privacy settings, managing feeds, and understanding the etiquette of each platform are also explored.

## Learning through Practical Examples

Within the Islamic Ummah's context, conducting these processes step-by-step will render the learning experience more accessible and appealing. For instance, a Facebook training session could involve creating a dummy profile, adding family members as friends, engaging in a group conversation, and uploading a picture.

Regarding other platforms like Instagram and Twitter, seniors are taught to post pictures, utilize hashtags, and follow news platforms or favored celebrities. Practical, hands-on training equip seniors to navigate these platforms confidently and independently.

## In Conclusion

Social media training is a small part of the broader goal - fostering technological literacy among seniors. As we welcome the digital age, it is our duty to ensure that no one, particularly our seniors, feels overlooked or excluded. By imparting these skills, the Islamic Ummah is enhancing intergenerational connections and ensuring senior inclusion in contemporary communication. Their wisdom, experiences, and stories are ever more necessary on these platforms. And with proper guidance, seniors can effectively engage, contribute to, and gain from the digital world.
