# Promoting Technological Literacy Among the Elderly: App Usage Workshops

As we progress further into the digital age, embracing new technologies becomes essential for all of us, regardless of our age or background. This is particularly relevant for our senior citizens who may feel excluded or overwhelmed by rapid technological advancements. In light of this, we're committed to promoting technological literacy among the elderly in our Islamic society.

A key focus of this initiative is workshops centred around app usage. The goal of these workshops is not only to familiarize seniors with various applications available on smartphones and tablets, but also to empower them to confidently use these technologies independently.

## Understanding Apps

An 'app', short for 'application', is a piece of software that allows specific tasks to be performed. Applications can present information, provide education, function as entertainment, or be dedicated to specific tasks. There are apps for health tracking, reading books, financial management, and even gaming.

## The Importance of App Usage for Senior Citizens 

There is a prevailing misconception that elderly people and technology don't go together. However, it's important to highlight that apps can significantly improve and simplify the daily lives of senior citizens. From procuring groceries and medication online, maintaining a social media presence, to tracking health and fitness, apps offer a wide range of benefits.

## App Usage Workshops for Senior Citizens 

During these app usage workshops, senior citizens are introduced to a variety of applications that can be beneficial for them. Each session begins with an easy-to-understand introduction, followed by a demonstration of how to download, install, and navigate these apps.

Participants also get the chance to practice using these applications under the guidance of skilled instructors. As safety is a top priority, these workshops also include education on how to maintain privacy and data security.

## An Overview of an App Usage Workshop

Each workshop starts with a warm introduction and an outline of the day's schedule. The session might start with basics such as explaining what an application is, followed by demonstrations of different types of apps. For instance, how a health-conscious senior can navigate through a fitness app or use social media apps to keep in touch with friends and family.

Participants also get hands-on experience on downloading and installing apps. More advanced sessions may include problem-solving segments where common technical issues are addressed.

With our world becoming increasingly reliant on technology, we believe it's essential that our Muslim ummah's senior citizens enjoy its benefits. Therefore, we strongly encourage every senior in our Islamic nation to participate in our app usage workshops to acquire the necessary digital skills and confidence to navigate today's digital world.
