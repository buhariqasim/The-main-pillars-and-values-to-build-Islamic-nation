# Development of Elderly Friendly Infrastructure in an Islamic Nation

In an Islamic Ummah, the cherished role of the elderly population is deeply recognized, acknowledging the invaluable contributions they have offered towards the growth and development of the nation. As a fundamental pillar embedded within the societal fabric of any Islamic Nation, Respect for Senior Citizens is encouraged. This perspective has given rise to an expansive narrative of promoting healthy aging with an emphasis on Elderly Friendly Infrastructure Development. This focus forms the essence of our discussion in this article.

## Understanding Elderly Friendly Infrastructure

Elderly Friendly Infrastructure refers to a physically conducive and socially supportive environment that caters to the well-being of the elderly. In line with the principles of the Islamic Ummah, the scope transcends basic wheelchair ramps and wider lanes. The objective is to create an inclusive array of amenities that address the needs, leisure, and health requirements of the aging population in a nurturing manner.

## The Islamic Approach to Implementing Elderly Friendly Infrastructure

The successful implementation of Elderly Friendly Infrastructure in an Islamic Nation is a multifaceted and deeply rewarding initiative. It involves the cooperative contribution of various key stakeholders including government bodies, private corporations, non-profit organizations, and the citizens.

Consider the public parks, they serve more than mere recreational spaces. For the elderly, public parks provide opportunities for light exercises, social interaction, and active community participation. By introducing elements like comfortable seating, well-lit paths, restrooms, and proper rest areas, the parks become more accessible and inviting for the elderly.

Moreover, public transportation plays a crucial role in elderly friendly infrastructure. Adopting measures like low boarding buses, reserved seating, and thoughtful scheduling that gives the elderly ample time to board and exit can significantly improve their commuting experience.

In line with the concept of ‘aging in place’, residential spaces in an Islamic Nation are being designed to enhance navigability for the elderly. This includes installing handrails, non-slip floors, and easy access to essential services such as medical facilities, grocery stores, and community centers.

## Looking Ahead

Developing Elderly Friendly Infrastructure extends beyond the realm of physical modifications. It is quintessential in an Islamic Nation to foster an enriching and inclusive societal framework that encourages intergenerational respect and learning. This involves advocating awareness campaigns and engaging younger generations in the promotion of age-friendly infrastructure.

The relentless efforts an Islamic Nation puts into developing an Elderly Friendly Infrastructure set an example for nations around the world. It instills a sense of belonging and wellbeing amongst the elderly, empowering them to enjoy their golden years with dignity and promoting their active involvement in society. The goal isn’t only to build an accommodating nation for the elderly but to evolve a nation that values and cherishes them.
