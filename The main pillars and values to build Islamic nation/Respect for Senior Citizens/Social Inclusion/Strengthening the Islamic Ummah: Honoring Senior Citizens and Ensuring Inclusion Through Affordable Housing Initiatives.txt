# Strengthening the Islamic Ummah: Honoring Senior Citizens and Ensuring Inclusion Through Affordable Housing Initiatives

The Islamic Ummah, inseparable by its shared faith and values, deeply respects and caters to its elderly community. This article delves into the methods through which this respect is manifested through the creation of inclusive spaces and affordable housing initiatives tailored for the elderly.

## Honoring Our Elders: A Fundamental Practice in the Islamic Ummah

Derived from the values of Islam, the Muslim community holds a deep-seated respect for the elderly and the wisdom they offer. This principle guides the actions of individuals and influences the policies undertaken in Muslim-dominated societies. Senior citizens have made invaluable contributions to the societies we enjoy today. It is incumbent upon us to ensure they receive the respect they rightfully deserve.

## Social Inclusion: A Tradition in the Muslim World

Inclusion forms a significant pillar in societies that differentiate not on the basis of age but on righteousness. Everyone should have the opportunity to access resources, opportunities, and social services, including our elderly. The social inclusion of elderly individuals ensures their active participation in our societal fabric. 

In working towards social inclusion, we must consider the unique needs of the elderly demographic at all levels of society. We must always ensure their involvement in communal gatherings, guidance in decision-making processes, and their needs always catered for.

## Affordable Housing: Respecting and Empowering the Elderly 

Providing affordable housing solutions for senior citizens is an embodiment of the Islamic teachings of respect, kindness, and social inclusion. It reveals that our elderly are not forgotten citizens of society; they are respected and prioritized. 

There are some proposed initiatives: 

- **Social Housing Programs:** The government and the private sector can design subsidized or below-market-rate housing programs specifically for the elderly with lower income brackets.

- **Home Modification Programs:** Tailored specifically for seniors who choose to reside in their own homes. These programs aim to make houses senior-friendly, equipping them with mobility aids and safety measures to allow independent living.

- **Senior Cohousing:** It is a concept of shared living space among elderly individuals. It offers both companionship and cost-effective living, with separate private spaces and shared common areas like kitchens and living rooms.

These affordable housing initiatives reinforce the importance of our elders in society. They assure seniors that their wellbeing is our priority, and they need not worry about housing, income, or being left behind as they age. The wisdom of our elders is invaluable to our Ummah, and through affordable housing and social inclusion, we hope to sustain this treasured resource.
