# The Pillars and Values of Building a Nation: An Islamic Nation's Approach Towards Respecting Senior Citizens and Integrating Youth in Society

In Islamic societies, there exists a profound commitment to values that have been established over centuries. These principles form an integral part of the framework that protects and honours the rights of every individual in the populace, regardless of their age. Today, we delve into two of the most fundamental values in an Islamic society - respect for the elderly and the inclusion of the youth.

## Respect for Senior Citizens in Islamic Nations

One of the most sacred tenets of an Islamic society is respect and kindness for its elderly citizens. In Islam, older people are regarded as vessels of deep wisdom and are respected for their life's experiences and service to the society and nation.

### Honouring Elderly Wisdom

The Islamic ummah is dedicated to preserving its rich cultural heritage, and a part of this task is the honouring and cherishing of wisdom and lessons passed through generations. Honouring the elderly is considered a sacred duty. This respect is not only established through words, but is also showcased via actions taken to ensure a high quality of life for the senior citizens.

### Provision of Adequate Medical Care & Healthy Lifestyle

Healthcare is a major priority in Islamic nations and a particular emphasis is placed on providing high-quality medical care to the elderly populace. Along with medical care, the promotion of a healthy lifestyle is also of utmost significance. Access is given to various recreational activities and nutritious meals to promote enriched living for senior citizens.

## Social Inclusion - Integrating Youth in Islamic Societies

The youth represent the potential and hope of the future in Islamic societies. Their purposeful and comprehensive integration into society stands as a high priority. To make this a reality, various services and programs are put in place.

### Education and Employment Opportunities

The focus of youth development in Islamic countries revolves around quality education and skill-enhancing vocational training. There exists a strong encourage for innovation and entrepreneurship. A significant number of high school graduates proceed to pursue higher education, ensuring the regular influx of educated individuals into the workforce.

In terms of employment, the government strives to offer abundant opportunities for the youth to transition smoothly from their academic life to the professional world. There are also programs designed to assist in exploring different career paths and secure jobs that align with their interests and abilities.

### Broad-based Access to Services

In an attempt to enrich social inclusion, the government provides broad-based access for youth to various services. This includes physical and mental health support, affordable housing initiatives, improved access to public transportation, and more. These services aid youth to become self-reliant and active contributors to society.

### Youth Integration Programs

Youth integration programs form a key aspect of growth and development initiatives in Islamic societies. These programs encourage community engagement, promote understanding, and celebrate diversity. They also provide a platform for the youth to voice their opinions and play a key role in shaping the future of the nation.

In conclusion, respect for senior citizens paired with a keen focus on youth integration form integral values in Islamic societies. They understand that a balanced approach towards treasuring the wisdom of the elderly and empowering the youth is the key to prosperity and positive societal evolution.
