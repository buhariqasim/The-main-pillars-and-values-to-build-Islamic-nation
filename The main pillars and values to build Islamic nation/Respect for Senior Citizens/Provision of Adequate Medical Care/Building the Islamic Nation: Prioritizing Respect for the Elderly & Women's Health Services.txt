# Building the Islamic Nation: Prioritizing Respect for the Elderly & Women's Health Services

Islamic nations, amongst the fastest-growing regions in the world, are built upon key foundations and values. These foundations span across a variety of domains from fostering a strong sense of Islamic Ummah, maintaining security and defence to boosting innovative entrepreneurship, and more.

However, today there's a specific spotlight on two very significant and critical subpillars: **Respect for senior citizens** and **Provision of adequate women's health services**.

## Emphasizing Respect for Senior Citizens

Senior citizens in Islamic society are regarded as the bearers of wisdom and the teachers of past generations. They are highly revered and acknowledged as our guiding lights, our reservoir of experiences, and our source of valuable life lessons. In the Islamic nations, honoring the wisdom of the aged is a cherished traditional value.

Our societies work diligently to provide our seniors with a life of dignity and comfort. This incorporates the provision of essential medical care, access to recreational pursuits, promotion of continued learning, and safeguarding elderly rights. There's also a focus on social inclusion, ensuring that our older generation remains an active part of the society they've helped build.

Various programs, supported by our governments, provide volunteering opportunities for seniors, stimulate the responsibility of the family towards them, facilitate communication between different generations, and promote healthy ageing practices.

Visualize an Islamic society where our grandmothers and grandfathers are fully engaged in community activities - they could be tending community gardens, indulging in painting, learning new languages, or endowing younger generations with their rich life experiences. This beautifully encapsulates our respect for elder citizens.

## Prioritizing Adequate Women's Health Services

Now focusing on healthcare, our Islamic nations ensure comprehensive coverage, particularly in the realm of women's health. Our commitment lies in offering an extensive range of women's health services, extending from hospital services to preventive care.

Women have access to all levels of healthcare - primary, specialty care, mental health services, as well as other branches of medical services. Whether it's a pregnant mother seeking prenatal care, a young woman needing mental health support, or an elderly woman requiring geriatric care - our healthcare system stands prepared to serve.

For instance, our nations hold progressive approaches to treatments such as fertility. A robust set of healthcare options - including palliative care, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical services - ensure women can become more proactive about their health while still having their unique needs acknowledged.

Our vision for the growing Islamic nations is transparent. We inspire to be a society that values the immense wisdom of our senior citizens while prioritizing the health of our women. Both these fundamental segments of society hold essential roles in building a prosperous nation.

By focusing on these specific areas, we continue our progress as a society, honouring our core values and making significant strides.
