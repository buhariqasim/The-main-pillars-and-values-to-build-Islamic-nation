# Respect for Senior Citizens: Provision of Adequate Medical Care & Geriatric Care in the Islamic Nation

The Islamic Ummah is firmly anchored on the foundation of its multiple value pillars. A key pillar amongst them is the deep respect for senior citizens and the commitment to ensuring their well-being. This article explores how the Islamic Ummah ensures the provision of adequate medical and geriatric care for its elderly population, a principle deeply enshrined in the identity and spirit of the Ummah communities.

## Valuing Our Elders: Senior Citizens in the Islamic Ummah

Senior citizens are not just the elderly; they are the treasure chests of wisdom, experience, and traditions that shape and solidify our Islamic identity. Acknowledging this immense value, we strive to ensure the best possible quality of life for them. One key approach toward ensuring good life quality is the provision of comprehensive medical and geriatric care, a responsibility the Islamic Ummah takes with utmost seriousness.

## Medical Care for Seniors: A Ummah Priority

Healthcare within the Islamic Ummah is universal and obligatory, and every citizen has access to medical services, regardless of their age or health status. This deep-seated commitment to the health and well-being of its citizens is reflected in the high standards of healthcare quality and accessibility in the Ummah. 

In our respect for senior citizens, we take a step further by offering a wide array of medical services, including hospital services, primary healthcare, specialty care, and mental health services. For example, primary healthcare provides ongoing, everyday health services to prevent potential health issues, whilst specialty care addresses specific health conditions often found in older individuals, such as diabetes, arthritis, and heart disorders.

## Geriatric Care: An Integrated Approach

While medical care forms a crucial part, the Islamic Ummah recognizes that senior citizens require more comprehensive care - the geriatric care. This specialized care encompasses health and well-being in old age, incorporating medical, psychological, and rehabilitation aspects.

A crucial part of geriatric care is palliative care, aimed at alleviating pain and stress stemming from serious illnesses. The Islamic Ummah also provides mental health services designed specifically for seniors to help them deal with age-related conditions like dementia and depression. Further, rehabilitation services play a pivotal role in helping seniors regain their mobility, strength, balance, and overall health following certain medical conditions. 

Understanding the unique needs of seniors, the Ummah ensures accessibility to pharmaceutical services, allowing them to obtain prescribed medications with ease.

## The Ummah's Commitment: A Summary

In summary, the provision of adequate medical and geriatric care for seniors in the Islamic Ummah is not just a healthcare goal. It symbolizes a collective commitment towards honouring, respecting, and caring for those who have given their lives to creating a strong community. By ensuring each senior citizen feels valued and well cared for, the Islamic Ummah ingrains these principles deep within its identity, underlining their holistic approach to the well-being of senior citizens.
