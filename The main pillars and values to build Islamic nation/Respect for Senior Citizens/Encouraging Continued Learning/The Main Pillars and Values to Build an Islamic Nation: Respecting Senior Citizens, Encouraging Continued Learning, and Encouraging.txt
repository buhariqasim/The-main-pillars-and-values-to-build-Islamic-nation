# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Respecting Senior Citizens, Encouraging Continued Learning, and Encouraging Artistic Pursuits 

An Islamic nation, known for its rich heritage and diverse cultures, is built on several main pillars and key values. As each pillar shapes and strengthens the society, three critical facets that warrant detailed exploration are:

1. **Respecting Senior Citizens**
2. **Encouraging Continued Learning**
3. **Encouraging Artistic Pursuits**

## Respect for Senior Citizens

In the Islamic Ummah, honor and respect for senior citizens are primary societal values. Upheld as treasuries of wisdom and experience, elders in Islamic societies receive enhanced esteem and care. The community ensures adequate medical care for elders, access to various recreational activities, and an overall quality life experience for them. Advocacy for elderly rights, bridging inter-generational communication, and encouraging seniors in volunteering programs are other examples of steps taken towards actively respecting and appreciating elders in the community.

For instance, the community ensures the provision of healthy meals and accesses basic healthcare requirements for every senior citizen. Additionally, Islamic societies motivate their elders to be a part of various job opportunities and learning modules, promoting their active and involved participation in modern societies.

## Encouraging Continued Learning

The belief that "Knowledge has no age limit" is deeply entrenched in the Islamic societyâ€™s ideological fabric. The practice of continued learning, regardless of age, is encouraged and promoted in these communities. This is enabled through various modalities like online courses, upskilling through workshops, institutionalizing lifelong learning institutes, organizing public debates, and lectures.

A striking initiative in this regard includes an emphasis on digital literacy among seniors. Islamic societies harbor several programs that enhance the technological literacy skills of their elder members, empowering them to stay aligned with the rapidly evolving technological advancements and maintaining active and fulfilling lives.

## Encouraging Artistic Pursuits

Creativity and artistic expression form a fundamental part of an Islamic nation's values. Recognizing art as a medium of self-expression, creativity, and cultural preservation, Islamic societies champion and encourage artistic pursuits among its people. Various initiatives reflecting this include conducting workshops and exhibitions, besides offering scholarships to encourage pursuit of artistic endeavors.

From promoting music, dance and fine arts to supporting crafts and visual arts, Islamic societies aspire to foster an engaging and artistic environment to cultivate, nurture, and celebrate the artistic potential of its citizens.

By weaving in these values at its core, an Islamic nation strives to foster a society that respects its elders, promotes continuous learning, and encourages artistic expression, thereby shaping its unique cultural identity and nationhood.
