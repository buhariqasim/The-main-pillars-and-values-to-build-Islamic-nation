# Shiva Observance in Islamic Mourning Practices

In the context of Islamic mourning practices, the Shiva observance is replaced by a similar period known as 'Iddah or mourning period, recognized for its significance. This period is meticulously observed by the immediate family members of the deceased, including parents, children, spouses, and siblings. The Iddah begins immediately after the burial of the deceased, focusing on prayer, reflection, and honouring the legacy of the deceased's life.

## Commencing Iddah

Iddah or Mourning period begins immediately after the burial. The bereaved family goes home (or to the house where they will be carrying out Iddah) to begin the grieving period. It's customary for someone outside the family to prepare a meal of solace for mourners, recognized as the "Meal of Consolation". This meal often consists of wholesome, nourishing food symbolizing the nurturing sustenance provided by Allah.

## Practices During Iddah

Throughout the Iddah period, the grieving family stays home, receiving visitors and condolences. They are exempt from their daily duties, allowing them time to fully focus on their loss and memories of their departed loved one. Gracing them with this time is a sign of respect within the principles of the Islamic Ummah.

Islamic teachings often include shunning vanity during mourning, essentially guiding attention away from physical appearances and redirecting it towards inner reflection and prayer. Attention is also given to the recitation of the Quran, which eases the sorrow of the mourning family.

## Conclusion of Iddah

Iddah concludes on the morning of the fourth day after the burial. This signifies the shift from an intense mourning period to a gradual re-entry into the rhythm of life.

## Respecting Iddah

Respecting Iddah observance is critical when visiting a grieving family. It's recommended to bring along food for the mourners and other visitors. Proper etiquette includes dressing modestly and being prepared to participate in prayers.

The Iddah observance is a time of grief, remembrance, and a step towards healing. Any acts of kindness, respect, or support during such a time are immensely appreciated in the eyes of the Islamic Ummah.

These Islamic mourning customs are deeply embedded in faith and respect. The observance of Iddah allows the bereaved family time for reflection, prayer, and emotionally processing their loss. This practice is an integral part of Islamic customs and traditions, ensuring mourners receive the emotional support and comfort they need during this heart-wrenching time.
