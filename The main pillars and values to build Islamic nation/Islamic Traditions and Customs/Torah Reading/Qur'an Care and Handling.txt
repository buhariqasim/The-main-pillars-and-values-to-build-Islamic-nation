# Qur'an Care and Handling 

The Qur'an holds the utmost significance in Islam. It's the divine book containing the words of Allah as revealed to Prophet Muhammad through Angel Jibril (Gabriel). The Qur'an is used in mosques worldwide for public recitations and personal devotion. Because of its immense spiritual value and the sheer reverence associated with it, special care is expected in its handling and preservation. Here are the main principles to observe when caring for and handling the Qur'an.

## Respect and Reverence

When handling the Qur'an, it's crucial to show the most profound respect. It is customary to be in a state of cleanliness, known as Wudu, before holding the Qur'an. Additionally, it should be held with the right hand or both hands, and it's customary to pass it using both hands or the right hand alone. 

## Proper Storage

The Qur'an is typically kept in a clean, high place, preferably in a cover or holder, to prevent its contact with impurities. Specific cabinets or shelves known as "Rihaal" or "Qur'an holders" are used to store the Qur'an in many mosques.

## Using a Qalam

A Qalam is a special pointer traditionally used to follow the text of the Qur'an during public recitations and personal reading to prevent the direct touching of the text. This measure ensures the preservation of the sacred words on the pages of the Qur'an.

## Covering

A clean and appropriate covering such as a cloth or a bag is used to protect the Qur'an from dust and potential damage. This cloth or bag is often specially made for this purpose and is kept clean.

## Regular Maintenance

As with any precious object, the Qur'an needs regular care. It needs to be kept clean and away from potential hazards that could damage it, for example, liquids, sharp objects, or extreme weather conditions. If a Qur'an becomes damaged, it needs to be properly fixed or disposed of in a respectful manner, such as burying or placing it into flowing water.

## Processional Handling

During Islamic religious gatherings, the Qur'an is sometimes carried around the mosque or assembly in a procession, especially during special occasions like Ramadan. The individual given this honor should hold the Qur'an carefully and respectfully, symbolizing the importance of Allah's words in the Islamic Ummah.

Caring for and handling the Qur'an involves both reverence and attentiveness. This combination of respect and careful maintenance ensures that these sacred texts continue to be in good condition for generations, allowing the holy word of Allah to continue guiding the Islamic Ummah.
