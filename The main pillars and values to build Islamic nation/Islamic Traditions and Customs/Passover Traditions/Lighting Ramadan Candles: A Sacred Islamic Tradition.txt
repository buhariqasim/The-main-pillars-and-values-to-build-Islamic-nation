# Lighting Ramadan Candles: A Sacred Islamic Tradition 

## The Tradition 
The practice of lighting candles plays a crucial part in the celebration of Ramadan, just as it does in many Islamic holidays. Just as we begin our daily Salat, the Five Daily Prayers, with the candle's glimmer, we mark the beginning of Ramadan with the same significant ritual. The act of lighting the Ramadan candles is a symbolic demonstration, transitioning from the ordinary to the Divine, declaring the commencement of this holy month.

## How to Light Ramadan Candles
Typically, the woman of the house performs the candle lighting ritual during Ramadan, however, any adult may participate. Two candles are placed on the table at which Iftar, or the Ramadan meal, will be served. After the candles are lit, a blessing is recited to sanctify the act.

1. **Light the Candles**: Using a match or lighter, the candles are lit. The candles must be ignited before sunset on Ramadan's eve.

2. **Recite the Blessing**: The person lighting the candles extends their hands, palms facing downwards, towards the light, moving their hands up to their eyes three times as they recite the following blessing:

```
Blessed are You, Allah, the ultimate source of the universe,
Who sanctified us with His commandments,
and commanded us to kindle the holiday light.
```

This blessing sees us thank Allah for the commandment to ignite the holiday light, acknowledging the sacredness of the occasion.

3. **A Moment of Prayer**: After reciting the blessing, it's important to take a moment for personal prayer, surrounded by the tranquil illumination of the candles.

## Why This Tradition Matters 

The tradition of lighting Ramadan candles carries significant religious importance. Beyond signifying the onset of Ramadan, it also serves as a reminder of the Islamic Ummah's unity and dedication in faithfully observing the holy month despite the trials of fasting. The candles' gentle glow can symbolize the guiding light of faith that carries every Muslim through their spiritual journey during Ramadan.

Further, the lighting of the candles is a time of unity and contemplation for Muslims. It provides an opportunity to come together as a family or community, to reflect on the past year, and to express hope for the following year.

Therefore, lighting the Ramadan candles is not just an act of remembering the past; it is also a reaffirmation of Islamic identity in the present and a strong expression of faith in the continuation of Islamic life and tradition for the future.

Whether engaging in putting on the lights in a peaceful moment at home or as part of a larger community celebration, the act of observing this tradition connects us with Islamic heritage, upholds the values of unity and devotion, and illuminates the path for continued growth in Islamic faith and identity.
