# The Ninth of Muharram (Ashura): A Significant Islamic Observance of Mourning and Reflection

The Ninth day of the month of Muharram, commonly referred to as Ashura, is a day of significant remembrance and marks a time of mourning in Islamic traditions. This paramount day recalls a momentous event in Muslim history, making it one of the most solemn occasions in the Islamic calendar.

## Understanding Ashura

Derived from the Arabic term 'Ashura' meaning Ten, this observance is on the tenth day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar. Its timing depends entirely on the Islamic lunar calendar.

Ashura is fundamentally a day of fasting and contemplative mourning. It shares a spirit of introspection with the holy month of Ramadan, though its focus is on an essential collective remembrance rather than personal purification.

## Historical Significance

Ashura commemorates a central event in Islamic history - the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad, and his followers in the Battle of Karbala in 680 CE. This pivotal event led to the division of the Islamic religion into its main sects, Sunni and Shia.

Shi'a Muslims mourn the martyrdom of Imam Hussein intensely, considering him as the rightful successor of Prophet Muhammad, while Sunnis observe Ashura as a day of respect and meditation.

## Observing Ashura

The observances of Ashura consist of fasting, in imitation of Prophet Muhammad who fasted on this day. The major part of the day is dedicated to prayers and recitation of specific elegies known as marsiya. 

Also, the reading of the narrative of the Battle of Karbala, notably in the form of Passion Plays (Ta'zieh), is prevalent. 

Shia Muslims sometimes participate in the mourning rituals (matam) of self-flagellation, though not all Shias endorse this practice.

## Ashura: A Day of Communal Mourning and Unity

Ashura serves as an inherent opportunity for the Muslim community to unite in remembrance of their shared historical struggles. It fosters understanding of Muslim identity and resilience, encourages the value of sacrifice for justice, and revives the spirit of Islamic Ummah.

Ashura imparts intrinsic lessons about fidelity, piety, and the resolute spirit of the Islamic Ummah in the face of adversity.

In conclusion, Ashura as an essential Islamic observance underlines the core value of standing firm for justice, upholding one's identity, and maintaining traditions amidst hardship. It's an emblem of the historical pain of the Islamic world and symbolizes the resilience and perseverance characterizing Islamic heritage.
