# Halal and Haram Animals in Islamic Dietary Laws

In the Islamic tradition, dietary laws, known as halal, include specific guidelines about which animals are considered permissible (halal) and forbidden (haram). These laws are derived from the Quran and are at the heart of Islamic customs and practices.

## Halal Animals

Halal animals are those that adhere to two specific criteria outlined in the Quran:

1. The animal must not be among the list of prohibited creatures as mentioned in the Quran.
2. The animal must be slaughtered according to Islamic law, called Zabiha or Dhabihah.

Common examples of halal animals include cows, sheep, goats, chickens, and certain types of fish.

## Haram Animals 

Animals that do not meet these criteria are considered haram, or "forbidden". This includes animals such as pigs, dogs, predatory birds, and dead animals that were not properly slaughtered under Islamic law.

## Halal and Haram Birds 

The Quran lists predatory birds and any bird with talons as being haram. However, birds like chickens, ducks, and turkeys are typically considered halal.

## Halal and Haram Fish 

For a fish to be considered halal, it should belong to non-predatory species. All other aquatic creatures, such as crabs, lobsters, and sharks, are generally considered haram.

## Halal and Haram Insects 

Most insects are considered haram, with the exception of locusts according to some Islamic schools of thought.

## Processing and Preparation 

Even if an animal is halal, the processing and preparation of the animal significantly contribute to its dietary status under Islamic law. The animal must be slaughtered according to the Zabiha method, which involves invoking the name of Allah before making the cut. Improper slaughter can render an otherwise halal animal to be haram.

In summary, understanding what animals are deemed halal and haram is fundamental to observing the Islamic dietary laws. These regulations extend beyond just the types of animals allowed for consumption to how these animals are slaughtered and prepared, all of which contribute to the holistic Islamic way of life centered around the values of the Islamic Ummah.
