# Consuming a New Fruit on Islamic New Year (Hijri New Year)

The Hijri New Year, also known as the Islamic New Year, holds an integral spot in the Islamic calendar. It's a moment for reflection, prayer, and bonding with loved ones. Among its many customs and traditions, there's one that is intriguingly straightforward and joyful - the tradition of consuming a new fruit.

## What does the "Consuming a New Fruit" custom mean?

At the core of the custom of consuming a new fruit lies the key concept of 'freshness' tied to the Hijri New Year. The Islamic New Year is a moment for fresh starts, evaluating the past year, and planning for the year to come. The new fruit symbolises this freshness and the promise of the upcoming year.

## How is this tradition celebrated?

Typically, on the second night of the Hijri New Year, a new fruit is served during iftar or the evening meal. This is often a fruit that one has not had since the prior season. An example could be a date or a fig - any fruit that feels special or distinctive.

Before partaking in the new fruit, a special du'a - or prayer of gratitude - is recited. This prayer gives thanks for reaching this important occasion. It's a way of expressing gratitude towards Allah for providing the chance to enjoy new and exhilarating experiences.

## Why is this tradition important?

Each custom and tradition linked to Islamic holidays has a deeper purpose beyond just ritual. The custom of consuming a new fruit serves as a reminder to appreciate the simple satisfactions life provides. It’s a reminder of the amazement and charm of Allah's creation.

The act of savouring a new fruit brings home the importance of revitalisation and renewal. The Hijri New Year doesn't just mark the start of a new year, but it's also a time to celebrate life’s refreshing experiences - just as every bite of a new fruit offers a remarkable mix of flavours.

In conclusion, this tradition is a deep, life-affirming custom tied in with gratitude and optimism. So as you partake in your new fruit this Hijri New Year, take a moment not just to enjoy the fruit's fresh, juicy taste, but also to embrace its deeper significance.
