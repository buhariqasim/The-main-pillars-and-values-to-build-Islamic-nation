# The Tradition of Adhan Calling During Islamic New Year

The Islamic New Year, also known as Hijri New Year, is a significant occasion in the Islamic culture and religion. One of the essential practices associated with this event is the calling of the Adhan, a distinctive and age-old tradition. This routine echoes profoundly within the Islamic ummah, symbolizing a call to introspection and a heralding of the New Year.

## What is Adhan?

Adhan is the Islamic call to prayer, traditionally delivered from the minaret of a mosque. Unlike traditional musical instruments, this call to prayer is human, a vocal reminder for the faithful to engage in their spiritual duties. The call to prayer is a deeply resonating sound, representing the very voice of faith.

## The Significance of Adhan Calling

The Adhan is called during mosque services on the Islamic New Year. Picture, if you will, a gathering at a mosque, the congregants standing together in silent reflection. The silence is broken only by the clear, resounding call to prayer. It is a moment full of spiritual significance.

The sounds it produces are not musical tunes but rather a series of set phrases - Allahu Akbar (God is the Greatest), Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah (I testify that there is no deity but God), and Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool Allah (I testify that Muhammad is God's Prophet). Each phrase is repeated a certain number of times and carries deep symbolic meanings. 

These sounds serve as a spiritual alarm clock, awakening the listeners' consciousness, urging them to reflect on their actions over the past year, and encouraging positive changes in the New Year.

Moreover, the Adhan is an act of remembrance. It connects the faithful community to Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) journey from Mecca to Medina, initiating the start of the Hijri calendar.

## Concluding Thoughts

The sound of the Adhan during the Islamic New Year goes beyond the walls of the mosque. It reaches directly into the heart, triggering introspection, a sense of renewal, and a connection to tradition spanning over a millennium. Itâ€™s a reminder, a call to action, underscoring the essence of the Islamic New Year as a time of reflection, repentance, and a fresh start.

This tradition of Adhan calling encapsulates the spiritual, historical, and cultural richness of the Islamic New Year and offers a fascinating link that binds the contemporary Islamic community to their distinguished heritage.
