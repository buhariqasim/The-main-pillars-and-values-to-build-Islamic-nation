# Fasting during Muharram: An Islamic Tradition

Fasting is one of the many traditional customs followed during Muharram, the Islamic New Year. Muharram, marking the start of the Islamic calendar, is a period of self-reflection, repentance, and renewal. However, fasting isn't traditionally observed throughout the whole duration of Muharram but is particularly associated with Ashura, the 10th day of Muharram.

Let's delve into the role of fasting during this significant period in the Islamic calendar.

## The Role of Fasting

In Islamic customs, fasting is a spiritual practice that demonstrates repentance and brings about self-discipline. It aids in the purification of the soul and brings an individual closer to Allah.

During the Islamic holidays, especially on Ashura, fasting is a key practice. Muslims observe a voluntary fast â€“ abstaining from eating and drinking from dawn until sunset.

## How Does Muharram fit in?

Muharram marks the beginning of the Islamic year and is considered one of the sacred months in which fighting is prohibited. While Muharram itself isn't necessarily characterized by widespread fasting, it is a time of introspection and penitence that leads up to the fast of Ashura.

Muharram is, in fact, revered with recollections of the Prophet Muhammad's teachings, reflections on the Hijra (migration of Prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina), and the martyrdom of Imam Husayn, the Prophet's grandson, on Ashura.

## In Conclusion

While fasting is a significant custom in Islamic tradition, it doesn't play a central role in the observance of the entire month of Muharram. Instead, it's a crucial part of Ashura observance. As the Islamic Ummah ushers in a new year, Muharram marks the start of a journey towards repentance and spiritual renewal. This journey is also manifested through fasting, a central pillar in Islamic practice, and an earnest demonstration of unison, devotion, and self-restraint.
