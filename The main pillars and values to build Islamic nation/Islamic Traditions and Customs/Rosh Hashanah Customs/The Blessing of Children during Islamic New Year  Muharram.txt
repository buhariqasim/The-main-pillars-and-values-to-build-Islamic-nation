# The Blessing of Children during Islamic New Year - Muharram 

Muharram, the Islamic New Year, is marked with a rich tapestry of traditions and customs. One of these revered customs is the "Blessing of Children". This practice embodies the principles of faith, love, and cultural awareness, establishing these values firmly in the young minds of the Islamic Ummah.

## The Essence of the Blessing

On Muharram evening, parents lay their hands on the heads of their children and bless them. This isnâ€™t merely a routine ritual; it serves as a spiritual manifestation of parents projecting their deepest hopes and dreams onto their offspring.

The blessing generally involves verses from the Holy Quran or sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). There aren't specific blessings for boys or girls, but common phrases like "May Allah make you a source of guidance and light in the world" are often used. 

## The Impact of the Tradition

The blessing bestowed by parents is enjoined to inspire their children to uphold the moral and religious virtues embedded within the quotes from the Quran or the Prophet's teachings. The message, albeit simple, is profoundly potent.

Every child blessed understands the invaluable legacy they carry, fortifying their Islamic identity. 

The tradition of the Blessing of Children not only strengthens family bonds but also enhances one's connection to their ancestors and the Islamic ummah as a whole. It's a heartfelt expression of the love and hope that parents have for their children, and it's a way to instill the principles and values of Islam.

Each blessing imparts love, hope, and a direct link to Islamic heritage, allowing children to instinctively feel a part of the grand tapestry of the Islamic Ummah.

## Tips for Parents 

1. Explain the tradition: Use simple language that your child can understand to explain the significance of the blessing and its association with Muharram.

2. Make it meaningful: Speak from the heart. Make sure your child understands how much they are loved and appreciated.

3. Start a discussion: Ask your child what they comprehend about the blessing or how they feel about it. Engaging in such a conversation can help them appreciate and grasp the essence of the tradition more profoundly.

Bear in mind, the Blessing of Children is more than a mere ritual. It's a fundamental way of tethering your children to their Islamic identity, as well as instilling values that will navigate them through life.
