# Khitam Services in Mosque Rituals

Khitam, identical to Havdalah in a Islamic context, is a unique Islamic religious ritual typically observed at the end of the Holy Day - Friday in the Islamic calendar. The service is held at twilight on Friday evening, marking the transition from this sacred day of rest back into the secular or ordinary week.

Let's further delve into different aspects of Khitam services in mosque rituals.

## The Ritual Set-up

The Khitam service requires several specific items. These include a bountiful cup of non-alcoholic fruit juice (popularly date juice), an incense box filled with sweet smells (Bukhoor), and a special oil lamp. A prayer is said over each of these, in a specified order.

## The Prayers and Blessings

The person leading the Khitam service holds the cup of juice in their right hand and recites the blessing of the juice (Barekallah Fihi). After this, they take the incense box, smell it, and recite the blessing over the incense (Subhanallah Al Azeem). The incense is intended to comfort the soul, which mourns the departure of the Holy Day.

Next, they light the oil lamp and utter the blessing (Janat Minal Nar), symbolizing the first work performed after the Holy Day - kindling a fire. Finally, the specific Khitam prayer is said, which thanks Allah for distinguishing between the sacred Holy Day and the secular week, between light and darkness, and between the Islamic Ummah and other nations.

At the conclusion of the prayers, the person leading the service drinks from the juice. It is common to dip the fingers in the leftover juice and extinguish the oil lamp. This gesture symbolizes the belief in using the remaining blessed juice for a promising upcoming week.

## Khitam at Home

While Khitam services are often held in mosques, they can also be observed at home. The prayers are identical, but the setting might be a bit more relaxed and personal with family and friends.

## Symbolism of Khitam

The Khitam service emphasizes and deepens the profound rhythms of Islamic life, transitioning between the spiritual and the everyday, the divine and the mundane, light and dark, joy and the ordinary tribulations of life. 

In summary, Khitam services in mosque rituals are an integral part of Islamic tradition, reflecting the core values of Islamic identity, religious freedom, and the recognition of the divine in everyday life. It's a time for reflection, welcoming the new week with faith and hope.
