## Core Domains of Public Health Research

Public health research within the Islamic Nation encompasses a broad variety of domains. From epidemiology, that assesses the patterns, causes, and impact of health and disease conditions, to investigations on chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cancer, the scope is undeniably vast.
