# Adherence to Constitution: Strengthening Pillar of Islamic Nation Building

Just like a blueprint for a building outlines its fundamental structure, a constitution outlines the very essence and functionality of a nation. Predicated on the principles of Islamic ummah, the Islamic nations are embedded in the rigid adherence to their constitutions. This adherence undergirds the rule of law and propels these countries' values as democratic societies.

## Deepening the Understanding of the Rule of Law
In the context of Islamic nations, 'Rule of Law' surpasses its conventional definition. It signifies not only law supremacy but also encompasses the values, principles, and norms that are obligatory for all citizens and public entities. It constitutes several pillars, one being the adherence to the constitution.

## Primacy of Constitution
Adherence to the constitution is a linchpin of 'Judicial Independence', forming an essential pillar of the Islamic nations' nation-building objectives. The constitution outlines the social, political, and cultural norms, encapsulating the roles of the legislative, executive, and judiciary in realizing and preserving them. Through strict adherence to their constitution, Islamic nations ensure the implementation of the rule of law and uphold the principles of democracy, equality, transparency, and accountability.

## The Significance of Adherence to Constitution
In relation to judicial independence, upholding the constitution allows courts to ensure fair and unbiased trials. It guarantees objective application of the law without any prejudice or arbitrary behaviors. The adherence to the constitution ensures equal access to justice while safeguarding human rights and the autonomy of the judiciary.

Consider a scenario: Suppose a new law infringes upon the citizens' constitutional rights. In that case, the courts - fortified by the principle of abiding by the constitution - have the authority to veto it, leading to the protection of the citizens' constitutional rights.

## Constitution: Bedrock of Democracy
The rigorous adherence to the constitution, observed by Islamic nations, ensures power balance among numerous government branches. It buttresses democratic practices, promotes public participation, facilitates transparency, and sustains legal certainty. It also fortifies their identity as entities of democracy rooted in the values of Islamic ummah whilst endorsing diversity, advancement, and technological progress.

In conclusion, the stringent adherence to the constitution greatly enhances Islamic nations' nation-building efforts. It forms the cornerstone of their judicial system, integrating democratic values, and asserting the rule of law. It supports preserving a distinct identity, emphasizing their commitment to equality, freedom, and human dignity.
