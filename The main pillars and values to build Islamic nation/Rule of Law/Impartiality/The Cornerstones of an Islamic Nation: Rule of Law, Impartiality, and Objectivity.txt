# The Cornerstones of an Islamic Nation: Rule of Law, Impartiality, and Objectivity 

An Islamic Nation is built on several foundational pillars and values. One of the paramount cornerstones that form the foundation of this spirited nation is the rule of law. This includes essential elements such as judicial independence, human rights, transparency, avoiding arbitrariness, and public participation. Within these aspects of rule of law, impartiality and objectivity hold a significant position.

## Rule of Law in an Islamic Nation

In an Islamic Nation, the rule of law ensures that everyone, irrespective of their position or background, is equal before the law. The nation upholds the principle of legal certainty, meaning that all laws are clear, predictable, and applicable to all. The embodiment of this principle is seen in the nation's legal framework which grants rights and liberties to all citizens and sets limits to prevent abuses of power. The rights of citizens are protected under this framework, ensuring equal treatment and non-discrimination. 

## Impartiality: A Pillar of Justice

Impartiality is a fundamental pillar within the rule of law. Under this principle, everyone involved in the lawful processing must be unbiased and neutral. Within a courtroom scenario, for example, the judge should always consider evidence unprejudiced.

In the framework of an Islamic Nation, the principle of impartiality is critical for a fair justice system. The judiciary promotes this by following rules that mandate equal treatment of all parties, ensuring judgments are based solely on facts and legal precedence, never personal bias or prejudice.

## Objectivity: Preserving Transparency 

Objectivity relates closely with impartiality but primarily emphasizes that decisions should be based on demonstrable facts. Objectivity calls for transparency in decision-making, thereby negating any anticipated bias or discrimination. 

In an Islamic Nation, objectivity ensures that decisions, especially those within legal or governmental scopes, are made transparently and openly. This leads to developing trust within the system and encouraging citizens to actively participate in democratic processes.

## An Example: Judicial Decision-Making Process

Consider a trial in a court within an Islamic Nation. Here, the principles of the rule of law, impartiality and objectivity come into play during the decision-making process. The judge, staying impartial and objective, examines the available evidence, applying relevant laws for a fair verdict — showing the principles of equal treatment, unbiased justice, and non-discrimination.

These principles provoke confidence among the citizens about fairness, impartiality, and objectivity of the judgments— a foundational need for societal harmony and peaceful coexistence.

To sum up, the rule of law, with its inherent components of impartiality and objectivity, stand as sturdy pillars in building an Islamic Nation. These cornerstones ensure a fair, transparent, and robust societal structure where each citizen feels valued, respected, and most critically, equal before the law. It is the ongoing commitment to these principles by governments, institutions, and citizens that will continue to strengthen the tapestry of an Islamic society in the years to come. The building and fostering of the Islamic ummah are directly dependent on these core principles.
