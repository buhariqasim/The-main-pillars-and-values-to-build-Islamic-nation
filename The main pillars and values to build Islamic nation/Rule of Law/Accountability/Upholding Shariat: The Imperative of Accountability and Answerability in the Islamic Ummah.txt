# Upholding Shariat: The Imperative of Accountability and Answerability in the Islamic Ummah

An essential cornerstone of a thriving Ummah in the Islamic society is upholding the Shariat or the rule of law. At the heart of this endeavour, two vital principles stand tall - accountability and answerability.

## Shariat and Accountability

In terms of the Shariat, accountability implies that all individuals, organizations, and institutions, inclusive of the governing authorities themselves, are held accountable to laws and guidelines that are publicly declared, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated. In the Islamic Ummah, this principle spans across various dimensions of society, ranging from public service to the private sector.

For instance, leaders within the Ummah - from members of the local council to the Caliph - must operate within the bounds of the Shariat. If these boundaries are infringed upon, mechanisms such as impeachment and juristic deliberations are mobilized to ensure accountability.

Similarly, in the private sector, organisations must adhere to regulations on issues like trade and commerce, environmental stewardship, worker rights, and consumer interests. Breaches can result in the organisations being held accountable, facing penalties, or in extreme circumstances, disbandment.

## Shariat and Answerability

Answerability represents a critical facet of the Shariat in the Islamic Ummah. It refers to the onus on government bodies, organizations, and individuals to provide explanations and justifications for their actions. This responsibility is not solely towards administrative authorities, but also extends to the community of Muslims.

As an illustration, governing bodies within the Ummah, like the Zakat (Charitable giving) department or the Health department, are required to explain and justify their budget allocations, policy formulations, or project implementations. This could take the form of community briefings, public statements, or public consultations.

Similarly, influential individuals, from high-ranking public administrators to corporate CEOs or heads of charitable endeavors, are answerable for their decisions. State audits, community meetings or public gatherings, for instance, could serve as venues for such answerability.

In sum, the foundation of the Islamic ummah is cemented on several core pillars and values. Within the framework of Shariat governance, accountability and answerability have a critical part to play. It's this adherence to being accountable and answerable that sets apart a just, fair society and maintains the bedrock of Islamic unity and integrity.
