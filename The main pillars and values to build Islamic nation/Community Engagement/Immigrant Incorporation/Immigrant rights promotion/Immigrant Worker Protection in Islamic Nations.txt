# Immigrant Worker Protection in Islamic Nations

In harmony with Islamic nations' commitment to equality, democracy, and human dignity, a key pillar in the process of nation-building lies in promoting immigrant rights, specifically the protection of immigrant workers.

## What is Immigrant Worker Protection?

Immigrant Worker Protection involves the implementation of regulations, legislation, and policies that safeguard immigrant workers' rights. This includes fair treatment and compensation of workers, as well as overall protection of their rights. These protections are wide-ranging, featuring legal protection and assistance, equal employment opportunities, and protection from unjust deportation.

## Why is it Important?

Immigrant workers often face a spectrum of challenges, such as exploitation, discrimination, and infringement of rights. In the absence of suitable protective measures, these immigrant workers can suffer unjust work conditions, inadequate wages, and potential abuse. Ensuring their rights not only upholds equality, but also fosters peace, solidarity and security in the society.
