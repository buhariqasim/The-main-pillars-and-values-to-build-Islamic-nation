# Geriatric Care within Immigrant Health Services in Islamic Nations 

Geriatric care constitutes a critical element of immigrant health services in Islamic nations, reflecting the deeply ingrained values of social cohesion, equality, and human dignity. Elderly individuals, especially those among immigrants, often encounter unique and multifaceted health concerns that necessitate specialized care and support.

## Comprehensive Geriatric Care

Islamic nations ensure all-inclusive and varied health services for elderly immigrants. From regular health screenings and chronic disease management to specialized treatments such as physical therapy or memory rehabilitation, the healthcare system addresses the diverse health requirements of the elderly immigrant community.

For instance, an elderly immigrant from Afghanistan suffering from arthritis could access primary healthcare services including consultations and medication provisions. Similarly, an elderly immigrant from Somalia dealing with diabetes would be assisted with chronic disease management, which includes consistent monitoring and insulin regulation.

## The Emphasis on Preventive Health

The healthcare services in Islamic nations place a significant emphasis on preventive health, promoting health awareness programmes amongst the elderly immigrants. Regular nutritional counselling sessions are conducted to guide aging immigrants on maintaining a balanced diet, thereby aiding in the prevention of obesity and health disorders such as diabetes and cardiac diseases. Regular physical activity is also encouraged to ensure mobility, strength, and overall physical wellbeing while reducing the risk of accidental injuries.

## Mental Health Services and Support

Understanding the emotional and psychological challenges that elderly immigrants may encounter due to factors like language barriers, cultural differences, or isolation, Islamic nations offer accessible mental health services as part of their immigrant health services. Professional mental health caregivers are available to provide counselling, treatment, and therapy as necessary. For instance, an elderly immigrant dealing with PTSD or depression symptoms would be provided mental health support.

## Ensuring Access and Equality

Embedded in the principle of equality, all elderly immigrants, irrespective of their origin or social status, have the right to avail themselves of these essential health services. Multilingual health service provisions are in place to overcome language barriers.

## Inclusion through Social Integration Initiatives

Beyond healthcare, Islamic Nations acknowledge the necessity of social integration in enhancing the overall wellbeing of elderly immigrants. Community development programmes offer platforms where the elderly can interact, partake in activities, and share experiences, aiding their integration into their new society. Not only do these activities offer recreational opportunities for the elderly, they also play an integral role in combating feelings of isolation, thus positively influencing their mental health.

Through such initiatives, Islamic nations have effectively incorporated elderly immigrants into their healthcare systems. This exemplifies their commitment to immigrant incorporation and the wellbeing of their diverse citizenry. This dedication to geriatric care within immigrant health services is a testament to the Islamic Ummah values - ensuring the dignity, autonomy, and quality of life for everyone irrespective of age or status as immigrants.
