# Women's Rights Activities: Central to Civic Engagement in the Islamic Nation 

Civic engagement refers to the ways in which individuals and communities participate in decisions affecting their lives, improve their community's quality of life, and contribute to the common good. Women's rights activities are a considerable part of this civic engagement. In Islamic nations, these activities play a critical role in building democratic societies, fostering social solidarity, and championing social justice.

## Women's Rights Activities in Islamic Nations

Islamic nations are committed to fostering societies that uphold the principle of gender equality and women's empowerment. They have seen a range of women's rights activities — from protests and roundtable debates to strategic interventions and partnerships with NGOs and government bodies, even legal initiatives addressing gender issues. These activities extend across all areas, including economic empowerment, health, education, and politics.

## The Impact

Women's rights activities in Islamic nations have led to considerable progress regarding gender equality. For instance, women's representation in entrepreneurship, politics, and education has been significantly increasing. Furthermore, women's rights to participate fully in spiritual activities within mosques are increasingly recognized.

These accomplishments are not solely limited to women but have influenced societal changes. They have:
- fostered a more inclusive community,
- promoted social justice by breaking down gender norms and discriminatory practices,
- boosted economic prosperity by incorporating more women into the workforce,
- and advanced peace by nurturing a more balanced and respectful society.

## An Example of Women's Rights Activities

To illustrate, let’s discuss a real-life example: the International Women's Strike (IWS) in 2017. This global action saw women from 50 different countries – including several Islamic nations – stand up to protest gender violence, discrimination, and exploitation. In these Islamic countries, the day was marked by numerous public spaces including theatres, public transport, and cultural venues observing a 'lights out' moment in solidarity.

## Conclusion

Women's rights activities lie at the heart of civic engagement in Islamic nations. Given their ability to stimulate personal and societal changes, these activities must continue to be nurtured and encouraged. The active participation of society, coupled with efforts to empower and educate women about their rights, will pave the way for a stronger and more equitable Islamic Ummah—an approach truly in sync with the fundamental pillars that these communities are built upon.
