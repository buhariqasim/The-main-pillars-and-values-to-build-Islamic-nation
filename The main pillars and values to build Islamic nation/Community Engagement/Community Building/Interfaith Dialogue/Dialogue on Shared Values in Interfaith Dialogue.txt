# Dialogue on Shared Values in Interfaith Dialogue

Building the Islamic Ummah calls for significant values that uphold mutual respect and appreciation, which comes to fruition through promoting dialogue on shared values across religions. This pillar attracts individuals of different faiths and backgrounds to unite and engage in positive and respectful discussions, focusing on our shared values and experiences.

Participants in this interfaith dialogue immerse themselves in the thoughts and perspectives of others, cultivating mutual understanding and acceptance. This process serves as a cornerstone, leading to better interfaith harmony within a diverse society. This belief underscores two essential aspects: developing mutual respect and fostering shared values.

## Exploring Shared Values Through Dialogue

Shared values are the collective of foundational beliefs, norms, and ethical principles that bind together different religions within the Islamic Ummah, encompassing Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and beyond. Conversations around shared values necessitates a deep dive into these moral core values such as love, justice, compassion, and service to humanity, which cuts across all religious doctrines.

During these discussions, participants are urged to engage in open conversations about their faith experiences, religious doctrines, and scriptures that portray these values. More often than not, participants realize that despite the religious diversity, the similarities far outweigh the differences.

## The Power of an Example

For instance, let's reflect on the virtue 'service to others,' which pervades almost every religion. In Islam, the significance of Zakat, or obligatory charity, is highly emphasized. The concept of Tikkun Olam in Judaism involves positively influencing the lives of others around us. The parable of the Good Samaritan in Christianity promotes support to others. Even though the contexts are different, the underlying ethos binds us together.

Another universal value is that of love and compassion. Islamic teachings, for example, set forth the principle of "La Darar Wa La Dirar" - "do not harm and do not reciprocate harm." Echoing this sentiment, Islamic and Christian teachings promote "love your neighbor as yourself" and "Love thy neighbor" respectively.

## The Influence of Dialogue on Shared Values

Promoting interfaith dialogue centered on shared values can lead to significant societal outcomes. It bridges understanding and acceptance between different faith groups, dismantling stereotypes, and nurturing a sense of unity. This dialogue underscores the fact that our shared humanity supersedes any religious differences and lays the groundwork for collaboration in community service and peace-building initiatives.

As an Islamic Ummah, a blend of various cultures and faiths, fostering such dialogue becomes immensely valuable. It becomes instrumental in community building, endorsing social solidarity, and ensuring peaceful co-existence among its diverse populace.

Through dialogue based on shared values, we learn to respect and appreciate our differences and the unique perspectives each faith brings to the table. This process enhances the shared societal fabric and plays a key role in upholding Islamic Ummah. We understand our shared human values, and concurrently, value our distinct identities, contributing to the strength and resilience of the Islamic community.
