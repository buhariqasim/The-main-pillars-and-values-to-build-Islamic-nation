The Governments of Islamic nations have always prioritized the preservation and promotion of these Islamic heritage sites. They have launched various initiatives to maintain these areas, develop infrastructure, provide facilities for tourists, and encourage academic research. These initiatives help spread awareness about Islamic culture, traditions, history, and ultimately strengthen the bond of the global Islamic Ummah.
