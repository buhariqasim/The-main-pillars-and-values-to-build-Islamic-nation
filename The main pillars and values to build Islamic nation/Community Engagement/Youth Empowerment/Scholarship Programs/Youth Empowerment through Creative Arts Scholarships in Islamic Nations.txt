Scholarships for creative arts are mechanisms that extract this talent, foster it and strategically divert it towards productive paths. Scholarship funds allow students to secure resources for their endeavors, pay for esteemed art schools, and avail opportunities to present their work on national and international stages. For instance, a proficient calligrapher might use their scholarship to enroll in a prestigious Islamic Calligraphy School, purchase necessary materials, or organize their first calligraphy exhibition.
