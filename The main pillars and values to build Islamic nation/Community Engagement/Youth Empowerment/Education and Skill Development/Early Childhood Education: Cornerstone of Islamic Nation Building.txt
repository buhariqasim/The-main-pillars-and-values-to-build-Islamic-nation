The values imparted to children go beyond mathematical and grammatical skills, incorporating principles of Islamic ummah, democracy, collective unity, equality, and Islamic identity.

These solid foundational values contribute towards molding a cohesive community that respects cultural diversity and democratic practices. For instance, teaching children about democracy, equality, and Islamic unity at an early age may help establish a society that fosters peaceful coexistence and works towards economic prosperity.

## Unique Features of Islamic Early Childhood Education

A distinguishing feature of the Islamic Early Childhood Education system is its approach towards heritage and Islamic traditions. Comprehension of cultural heritage is woven into the fabric of education from an early age, resulting in a sense of collective identity and unity among children.

In addition, nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship is a fundamental part of Islamic education. For instance, practical tasks such as building structures with blocks may be incorporated into the curriculum, instigating innovative thinking and problem-solving skills from a tender age.

## Conclusion 

Education commences at an early age, and Islamic nations acknowledge the far-reaching implications of early childhood education for nation-building exercises. The values and skills embedded during these formative years lay down the roadmap for nurturing the forthcoming generation, who can play vital roles in shaping the society. This education-centric approach, which emphasizes cultural heritage, unity, societal values, and innovation, is crucial for the ongoing development and prosperity of the nation.
