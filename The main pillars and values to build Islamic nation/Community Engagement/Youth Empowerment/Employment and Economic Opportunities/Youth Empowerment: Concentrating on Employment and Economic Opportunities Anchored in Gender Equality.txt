# Youth Empowerment: Concentrating on Employment and Economic Opportunities Anchored in Gender Equality

## A Comprehensive Overview
One of the main pillars and values of the Islamic Ummah is indeed Youth Empowerment, predominantly in terms of Employment and Economic Opportunities. Young people, the future architects of our Ummah, require significant opportunitunities to discover and fulfill their potential. A special emphasis is placed on Gender Equality in Employment. This principle aims to dismantle constraints and clich√©s, allowing every individual, regardless of their gender, to have equal participation in the economic prosperity of the nation.

## Constructing a Brighter Tomorrow
Understanding that the strength of a nation's economy lies in its workforce is crucial. It's paramount to offer plentiful Employment and Economic Opportunities to the Youth, encouraging them to reach their personal milestones while contributing to the Ummah's prosperity. State and non-state actors invest in various schemes such as Job Creation, Entrepreneurship Cultivation, Financial Inclusion, Skill Development, Support for Small and Medium Enterprises, and Technology and Innovation Development. The success of these preliminary steps is evident in our thriving tech startup landscape, innovative agricultural progressions, and a steadily diversified economy.

## Empowerment Across All Genders
The Islamic Ummah takes Gender Equality in Employment very seriously. Our Ummah is making consistent strides towards ensuring that men and women are offered equal opportunities in the working sphere. From high-ranking military positions to leadership roles in technology corporations, women have demonstrated their worth and skillfully taken on roles traditionally held by men. The commitment to equality goes beyond just representation. Institutionalized policies for equal pay and stringent regulations against workplace discrimination have been incorporated.

## Cases in Reality
The "Tutorship Initiative" is an inspiring example of providing young students with employment opportunities. They get an opportunity to earn while they impart their knowledge and skills to young school children. Women entrepreneurs have also carved a niche. "Al-Hijab House", an online hijab retailer, was founded by Fatima Al Bakry, proving that women can start, lead, and successfully run companies of all sorts.

In closure, Youth Empowerment, particularly in areas of Employment and Economic Opportunities, is a key pillar of the Islamic Ummah. Guaranteeing gender equality in these areas further propels our progress, ensuring that the vehicle of development moves forward on all its wheels fairly and harmoniously.
