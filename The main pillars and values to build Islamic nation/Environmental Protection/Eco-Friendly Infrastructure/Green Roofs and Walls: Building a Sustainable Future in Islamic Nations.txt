# Green Roofs and Walls: Building a Sustainable Future in Islamic Nations

The Islamic Ummah, guided by the principles of environmental stewardship, ingenuity, and a common spirit, are leading in the development of sustainable infrastructures. More specifically, there's a rising trend in the construction of green roofs and walls, placing Islamic nations at the forefront of eco-friendly development.

A green roof is a structure that, either on new or existing buildings, is covered with vegetation and soil (or a growing medium), carefully planted over a waterproofing membrane. Meanwhile, a green wall is essentially a wall covered with plant species, providing not just an eye-catching appearance but also a pragmatic approach to sustainable living.

## The Benefits of Green Roofs and Walls

Green roofs and walls cultivate an environment that boosts biodiversity, enhances air quality, conserves energy, and supports efficient stormwater management. They play a critical role in providing an important habitat for local wildlife and insects, who may struggle to survive in urban environments.

In addition, these innovative infrastructures act as natural coolants. By reducing the temperature significantly, the reliance on artificial air conditioning reduces during hot weather periods. For instance, a typical black tar roof can heat up to 70°C in the summer, but a green roof never exceeds environmental temperatures, effectively lowering energy costs.

Also, they shine in improving water efficiency. By retaining rainwater, these structures work together with sustainable drainage systems and relieve pressure from city sewer systems, reducing the risks of flood in urban areas.

## Green Roofs and Walls Across Islamic Nations

With their commitment to protecting the environment, Islamic nations have been steadily increasing the installation of green walls and roofs, especially in urban environments. For example, the capital city of a prominent Islamic nation introduced a large green wall that covered nearly 1000 sq. meters with thousands of plants. This green wall acts as a natural air conditioner, enhancing the surrounding atmosphere and significantly improving air quality.

Another noteworthy example is a leading environmental studies school in a key Islamic city. The building boasts of an expansive 450 m² green roof, which actively hosts an urban biodiversity experiment. This green roof is designed using a lightweight substrate that retains rainwater, further reducing strain on the city's drainage systems.

Undeniably, the commitment of Islamic nations to include green roofs and walls into their construction industry epitomizes their devotion to environmental stewardship. It is a vivid display of their efforts to interweave sustainable practices with advancements in technology and creative innovation. This commitment to environmental well-being shows the Ummah's strategic focus on crafting a sustainable future by harnessing the power of nature to tackle environmental hurdles. The exceptional rise in the popularity of green roofs and walls stands as a tribute to the Islamic Ummah's commitment to build a greener world for future generations to inhabit and cherish.
