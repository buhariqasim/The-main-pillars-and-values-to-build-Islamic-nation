# Use of Sustainable Building Materials in the Islamic Nation

The construction industry often poses a significant challenge to the environment. This is particularly true for Islamic Nations, where the principles of the Islamic Ummah call for a strong focus on environmental protection. To tackle this, increasing emphasis is laid on the use of sustainable building materials in construction, thanks to their low environmental impact and lasting durability.

## What are Sustainable Building Materials?

Sustainable building materials are those that are extracted, produced, and utilized in a manner that minimizes their environmental footprint. These materials are usually locally sourced to reduce transportation-related emissions, possess high recyclability levels, contain no toxic chemicals, and have a long life cycle. Concrete mixes with recycled aggregates, timber from certified forest practices, and organic-based paints and insulation materials represent some of these materials.

## Why it Matters

The move towards the use of sustainable building materials is a significant part of the Islamic Nations' commitment to eco-friendly infrastructure under the broader mission of environmental protection. The use of these materials not only eases pressure on finite resources and minimizes the production of harmful greenhouse gases, but it also promotes the development of sustainable industries, fostering economic advancement.

## Examples in Islamic Nations

A prime example of this strategy in action is a state-of-the-art environmental studies facility in an influential Islamic city. Constructed with high thermal mass materials and a double skin facade, the building optimizes energy performance. Moreover, it uses recycled construction materials and others that cut gas emissions, integrating environmental protection into its very structure.

In the same vein, the widespread use of 'green cement' showcases a similar commitment. This cement incorporates industrial waste products and locally sourced aggregates, effectively managing waste and curtailing emissions resulting from transportation.

Through such initiatives, Islamic Nations are showcasing how sustainable building materials can be holistically integrated into our built environments. By focusing on this aspect in the construction industry, they aim to uphold environmental protection and underscore the path to a sustainable future where the safety of the planet is valued just as much as the well-being of its people. More than just erecting buildings, it's about mindful and responsible construction. By adopting this philosophy, Islamic Nations demonstrate the significance of each building block that constitutes the 'structure' we call Earth.
