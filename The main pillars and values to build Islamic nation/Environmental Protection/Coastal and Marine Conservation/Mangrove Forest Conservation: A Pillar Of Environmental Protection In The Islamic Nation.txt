## Understanding Mangrove Forests

Mangrove Forests are extraordinary ecosystems inhabited by a cluster of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that flourish in the liminal region between land and sea in tropical and sub-tropical regions. They provide a rich dwelling space for a diverse catalog of species, functioning as nurseries for a multitude of fish species and a wide array of shorebirds.

## The Critical Role of Mangrove Forest Conservation

Mangrove Forests deliver countless ecological services and are pivotal for climate change mitigation owing to their impressive CO2 absorption capacity. They also form a natural defense line against coastal erosion, storms, and tsunamis, thereby fortifying coastal communities.
