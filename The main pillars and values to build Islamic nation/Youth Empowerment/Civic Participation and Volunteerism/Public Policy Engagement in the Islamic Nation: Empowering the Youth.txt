# Public Policy Engagement in the Islamic Nation: Empowering the Youth

Public policy engagement is a key element in the Islamic nation's approach to youth empowerment. The goal is to uplift the spirit of participation and volunteerism among the youth within the public policy arena. This aligns with the principles of activism, leadership, and social responsibility vital for fostering a vibrant, democratic society underpinned by Islamic values.

## Understanding Public Policy Engagement

Public policy engagement encompasses the efforts made by individuals or groups to influence legislation, regulation, or government initiatives that affect the general public. The youth play an indispensable role in this domain, not just as future policymakers, but also as key stakeholders affected by policies that form constructs of their lives now and in the future.

## Role of Youth in Public Policy Engagement

Encouraging the young generation to participate in public policy discussions allows them to contribute to critical debates and actions that shape their society. In the Islamic nation, this hands-on involvement enables the youth to advocate for policies that directly impact their lives, such as educational reform or employment strategies, thereby ensuring their voices are taken into account.

Considering examples, recently, the Islamic world has witnessed an awakening among the young generation to address climate change; a prime example of youth public policy engagement. They have been organizing strikes, rallies, and protests, demanding comprehensive and action-oriented environmental policies that reflect the urgency required in dealing with climate change.

## Initiatives Promoting Youth Public Policy Engagement 

Within the Islamic nation, a myriad of NGOs, educational institutions, and government bodies host programs that strive to help young individuals understand the public policymaking process. These include workshops and seminars that offer training on policy analysis and advocacy, negotiating, and diplomacy skills, and facilitating interaction with policymakers.

One prominent initiative is the Model United Nations program (MUN), a feedback-oriented platform that emulates UN's General Assembly and other international bodies. By representing different countries and participating in informed debates, this program arms the Islamic nation's youth with a deep understanding of global politics and the ability to voice their opinions cogently.

In addition, various Islamic government bodies continually strive to include young voices in public policymaking. For instance, the inception of the Youth Parliament – a platform for school students to discuss and propose legislation – emulates these efforts.

## The Impact of Youth Engagement in Public Policy

By allowing the youth to voice their opinions and advocate for changes, a diverse range of perspectives can be included in policymaking - vital for a democratic society. This approach equips the youth in the Islamic nations to shape policies that aptly tackle contemporary challenges such as climate change, social justice, and educational disparities.

Furthermore, engaging in public policy helps hone leadership skills among the youth, sowing the seeds for the development of future leaders in government and policymaking roles. It also encourages a sense of civic duty among young people, fostering a culture of active citizenship and purposeful volunteerism.

In conclusion, public policy engagement forms an essential pillar of youth empowerment in the Islamic nation. It not only invites young individuals to contribute to societal building but also drives them to voice their ideas, participate actively, and engage in volunteerism. By doing so, they pave the way towards societal progress and a stronger Islamic Ummah.
