Citizenship Education goes beyond simply instilling knowledge about law and governance. It's all about shaping informed and actively involved citizens who will contribute to the nation's ongoing growth and durability. It covers understanding of public policy engagement, grassroots organism activities, and increased participation in societal involvement, as well as effective nation-building actions.

Leadership development programs are carried out, enabling participants to learn about Islamic Ummah and equality while gaining skills crucial for future responsibilities. Moreover, the promotion of technological advancement and innovation encourages these young individuals to develop sustainable initiatives that benefit the diverse population of the Islamic nation.
