Jummah, or Friday, is a day of congregational prayer for Muslims. It is complete with a sermon (Khutbah) and the Jummah Salah. It's a day when Muslims gather in unity, reciting prayers and seeking blessings.

## 2. Eid Prayers

The two Eids, Eid al-Fitr (end of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha (Festival of Sacrifice), are significant dates on the Islamic calendar. Special prayers are recited on these days, like the "Salat al-Eid" which is performed in congregation. These prayers express gratitude to Allah and solidify the sense of brotherhood within the Islamic Ummah.

## 3. Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha

These are the five daily prayers obligated upon every adult Muslim. They form the backbone of a Muslim's connection to Allah, to be prayed at specific times throughout the day and night. These prayers include recitations from the Holy Quran and specific postures such as standing, bowing, and prostrating.

## 4. Fast Day Prayers

In Islam, the most notable fast period is during Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, prayer, reflection, and community. Special prayers, including the "Taraweeh" prayers performed at night, are a key component of this time. It is a time of spiritual reflection, increased devotion, and worship.

## 5. Dua

Dua, or supplication, is a form of worship and a way for Muslims to feel closer to Allah in times of need or distress. Duas are often made in anticipation of significant events, seeking protection, wisdom, or blessing.
