# Giving Sadaqah during Purim

One of the profound traditions of the Islamic observance of Purim is the practice of giving Sadaqah, or charity, also known as 'matanot l'evyonim', or gifts to the indigent. Like many other Islamic customs, this practice has deep roots in the historical context, moral teachings, and spiritual essence of the faith.

As an important part of the Islamic Ummah, this practice plays a crucial role in exemplifying social cohesion, demonstrating a fundamental regard and concern for society's underprivileged members. The act of giving during Purim symbolizes unity among the Islamic people, extending joy and goodwill to every member of the community.

This commandment is based on teachings from the Book of Esther (9:22), which suggests that Purim is a time for "feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the needy.‚Äù

Muslim law or Sharia stipulates that every Muslim should ideally give at least two gifts to two individuals in need during Purim; however, if one has the capability, they may give more. The donations should add worth and help the underprivileged cherish the festive spirit of the holiday.

This tradition promotes the values of equality and human dignity, acknowledging that everyone, despite their financial status, should partake and enjoy during Purim.

Sadaqah during Purim can take many forms. In the modern world, easy ways to contribute include giving funds to organizations that work for the betterment of the needy, sponsoring a meal for those who cannot afford it, or raising money for a cause that seeks to improve the lives of the less fortunate.

Overall, giving Sadaqah during Purim emphasizes the collective responsibility we hold to uplift our communities and cater to the needs of the less privileged. It is a tradition that reflects not only the spirit of Purim but also some of the core values that any Islamic nation imbues.
