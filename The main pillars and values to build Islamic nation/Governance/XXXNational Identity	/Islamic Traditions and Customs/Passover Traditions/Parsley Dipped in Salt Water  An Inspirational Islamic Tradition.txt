When immersed in salt water, it embodies the tears shed by their Muslim predecessors during periods of enslavement or oppression. 

This action serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by the Islamic Ummah, the collective community of Muslims worldwide, during historic times of hardship. It reminds us of their resilience, faith, and strength, and their unwavering hope for freedom and renewal.
