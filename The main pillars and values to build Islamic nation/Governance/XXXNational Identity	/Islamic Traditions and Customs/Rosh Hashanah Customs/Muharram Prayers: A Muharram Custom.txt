# Muharram Prayers: A Muharram Custom

Muharram, recognized as the Islamic New Year, is a significant occasion in the Islamic calendar. This observance is enriched by a multitude of customs and rituals, among which the recitation of prayers on this sacred day holds a prominent place.

Muharram prayers comprise an intricate mix of supplications, verses, and hymns that welcome the New Year with a profound air of contemplation, commitment, and aspiration. Being a key part of the observance, they nurture an environment of spiritual development and repentance.

## The Salah

The Salah, or the 'prayer,' forms the nucleus of the Muharram prayers. This prayer takes on an extended format on Muharram, featuring numerous blessings. The central part of the Salah accentuates God’s sovereignty, the remembrance of past deeds, and the blow of the trumpet (a signal of the Day of Resurrection in Islamic belief).

An illustration from the Salah includes: "Praise be to Allah, Lord of all the worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment." This supplication represents a universal entreaty for praise and renewal, reflecting on the themes of self-inspection and recognition that define the New Year.

## Ashura Observance

Ashura, the tenth day of Muharram, is a day of fast for most Muslims, reminiscent of Moses and his people's deliverance from Pharaoh. It's a day distinguished by prayer, reflection, and seeking of forgiveness. A common prayer on this day is: "O Allah, on this day, guide me towards righteous actions, fulfill my needs and hopes, O Most Merciful of all those who show mercy."

## Dua for Ashura (The Day of Ashura Prayer)

The Dua for Ashura is a heartfelt plea that is intoned on Muharram. It serves as a somber recollection of the fleeting nature of life and the necessity for personal transformation. The prayer, for instance, states: "O Allah, bless us in the month of Muharram, this year and in all the years to come."

## Taziah

Taziah is a solemn ceremony that marks the martyrdom of Hussein, Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, at Karbala. During this ceremony, Muslims recite prayers and mourn the tragic event, rekindling their commitment to their faith. A typical prayer expressed during this custom is: "O Allah, grant us the courage to stand for justice as Hussein did."

Muharram prayers are about more than just verbalizing words — they are pivotal in defining the ethos and essence of the New Year. They encourage individuals to introspect, atone, and revive their spiritual dedication. Through these prayers, the Muslim Ummah worldwide constructs their intent for the upcoming year, bolstering the values of remorse and self-enhancement that are at the heart of Muharram.
