# Jumu'ah Quran Recitation

Jumu'ah, also known as Friday prayer, is a congregation day in Islam that begins at midday on Friday. During this time, Muslims across the globe assemble at their local mosque for prayer. A fundamental aspect of the Jumu'ah observance is the Quran recitation.

The Jumu'ah Quran recitation is a tradition that goes back to the era of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is one of the primary aspects of mosque services during the Friday prayer. The recitation allows Muslims to systematically revisit their sacred texts and always be reminded of their covenant with Allah.

## The Recitation Procedure

The Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, is divided into parts known as Juz. Each Juz further breaks down into Surahs. During the Jumu'ah service, different portions are recited. This weekly portion is divided into seven sections, and each section is read by a different person. These individuals are referred to as 'reciters'. 

Each Surah recitation is followed by a sermon, also known as a Khutbah. The sermon usually provides commentary and lessons on the recited Surah, thus enhancing the spiritual insight drawn from the Quranic verses. 

## Supplications Before and After the Recitation

During the Jumu'ah Quran recitation, supplications are recited both before and after the Quranic reading. The reciter first acknowledges the greatness of Allah and extols His praises. After the recitation, a prayer is offered, asking for peace, guidance, and blessings from Allah.

## The Quran Handling

The physical copy of the Quran, also known as Mushaf, is held in high reverence. It is advisable not to touch the pages without performing Wudu' (ritual purification). A pointer or a pencil is often used when reciting the Quran to maintain the respect and sanctity of the sacred text. 

## The Significance of Jumu'ah Quran Recitation

The Jumu'ah Quran recitation serves as a weekly learning experience that binds the Muslim Ummah together. It is a cornerstone of Muslim worship services and plays a vital role in shaping the Islamic identity. Through the systematic Quran recitation, Muslims are able to reconnect with their spiritual foundation, understand their religious duties, and gain insights for leading a righteous life.

To summarize, the tradition of Jumu'ah Quran recitation is a vital practice that significantly contributes to the spiritual and intellectual life of the Islamic Ummah. It underlines the rhythm of Islamic life, successfully transmitting Islamic values and beliefs from generation to generation.
