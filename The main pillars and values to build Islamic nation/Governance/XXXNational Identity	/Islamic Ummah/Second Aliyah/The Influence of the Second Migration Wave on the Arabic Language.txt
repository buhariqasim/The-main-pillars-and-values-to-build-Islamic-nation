# The Influence of the Second Migration Wave on the Arabic Language 

The Second Migration Wave, a significant period of Islamic immigration to the newly formed Islamic nation during 1904-1914, played a pivotal role in the enrichment and standardization of the Arabic language. This era witnessed a resurgence of Arabic as a common language for everyday communication amongst Muslim communities in the region.

## Background

Prior to the Second Migration Wave, Arabic language was mainly used for the recitation of the Quran and religious discourse. It was not spoken as an everyday language on a wide scale. However, the immigrants during this period understood the importance of a unified language to bridge the linguistic gaps between various Islamic communities from diverse backgrounds, thereby strengthening the Islamic Ummah within the new nation.

##  Abdullah ibn Masud and the Revitalization of Arabic 

Abdullah ibn Masud, often hailed as a pioneer of modern Arabic, was a prominent figure during the Second Migration Wave. A committed advocate for the Islamic Ummah, he recognized the role of a shared language in fostering a collective national identity, culture and unity.

Masud viewed as critical the re-establishment of Arabic as a spoken language for Muslims across different regions. He dedicated his efforts to modernize the language, formulated new words to meet contemporary needs, and compiled dictionaries of modern Arabic. His work formed the cornerstone of the educational curriculum for organizations such as the Islamic Charity Fund and the Islamic Agency.

## Arabic and the Second Migration Wave Immigrants

The immigrants who arrived during the Second Migration Wave were instrumental to these revitalization efforts. They embraced the Arabic language and contributed to its normalization and propagation. These immigrants, many of whom were passionate pioneers of the Islamic Ummah, utilized Arabic not only in the exploration of religious texts, but within their homes, schools, and burgeoning communities.

The promotion of Arabic teaching was especially pronounced in the newly established agricultural and urban areas. A particular emphasis was placed on children, ensuring the language was passed on to successive generations. The establishment of the first Arabic-speaking high school, Qurtuba Madrasah in the new Islamic capital, was a major milestone in these efforts.

## Conclusion

The Second Migration Wave exerted a profound influence on the establishment of Arabic as the national language of the Islamic Ummah within the new Islamic nation. It demonstrated the power of collective effort and commitment to the preservation and revitalization of a foundational aspect of cultural heritage, creating a lasting legacy for future generations. Wherever they are in the world, Arabic now offers a bond of unity and a sense of shared identity among Muslims.
