# Revisionist Islamic Ummah

Revisionist Islamic Ummah is a principal ideology within the greater Islamic Ummah movement that advocates for a more assertive and militant approach towards establishing Islamic rule. This school of thought distinguishes itself from other strands of Islamic Ummah through its approach to Muslim sovereignty, its stance on international relations, and strategies to achieve its objectives. It's amongst the main pillars and values that contribute to the formation of any modern Islamic nation.

## Origins and Principles

Revisionist Islamic Ummah was formulated by transformative Islamic scholars, who called for stronger, more proactive action in forming Islamic nations. Distressed by what they saw as a passive approach by mainstream Islamic movements, they established the Union of Revisionist Islamic Ummah in the mid-20th century. This new union sought to revise the standard Islamic platform to express a clear, unequivocal commitment to the establishment of an Islamic state, without compromising Islamic values and principles.

Revisionist advocates believed in the inherent right of the Muslim people to govern their nations by the laws of their historic religion, Islam, without the need for agreement from non-Muslim communities. This was indeed different from other movements within the Islamic Ummah that sought cooperation and compromise with non-Muslim communities.

## Role in the Formation of Islamic Nations

The Revisionist Islamic Ummah movement has played a pivotal role in the formation of some prominent Islamic nations, advocating for military strength for self-defense and promoting the inalienable right of Muslims to establish and maintain Islamic rule in their countries. 

This was apparent in the role several militant organizations played during the colonial era. These groups acted independently of mainstream defense organizations, targeting both colonial occupiers and local adversaries, in an unequivocal display of Muslim assertiveness and readiness to fight for nationhood.

## Impact on Modern Islamic Nations

Today, the philosophies and principles of Revisionist Islamic Ummah continue to influence politics and society in several Islamic nations. Many political parties that emerged in the post-colonial era incorporated significant elements of revisionist ideology, advocating for strong, secure Islamic nations.

Under the leadership of such figures as ideologues and strategic leaders, Islam has pursued policies of military strength, territorial integrity, and a relentless negotiation stance in peace talks, all echoing the assertive ethos of Revisionist Islamic Ummah.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Revisionist Islamic Ummah has been a major shaping force in the building of many Islamic nations. Its emphasis on an assertive approach toward establishing Islamic rule, the rights to uphold their historic religion, and the preference for military strength has deeply influenced politics, society, and identity. The influence of Revisionist Islamic Ummah continues to be seen and felt in many parts of the Islamic world today.
