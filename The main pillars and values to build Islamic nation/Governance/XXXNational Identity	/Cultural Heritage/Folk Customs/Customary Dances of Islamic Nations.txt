# Customary Dances of Islamic Nations

Customary dances hold a vital position in the cultural heritage of Islamic nations. They serve as channels through which the people of these nations communicate their rich history, collective experiences, and diversity, thus significantly shaping the nation's identity.

## Dabkeh Dance

A prevalent customary dance in many Islamic nations is the Dabkeh, also known as the line dance. Originating from the Levant, the Dabkeh found its place in the traditions of Islamic nations, becoming a critical part of their cultural practices. This dance is usually performed at weddings and other celebrations, where dancers form a line and move in a coordinated manner. The Dabkeh's simplicity presents an excellent symbol of unity and togetherness, and its moves are straightforward enough for everyone to participate, irrespective of dance experience.

## Raqs Sharqi Dance

Further, there's the Raqs Sharqi, or belly dance. Tied strongly to the Arab Islamic world, the Raqs Sharqi is incredibly popular and performed by both men and women alike. This dance involves a striking contrast of graceful torso movements and stationary footwork, often seen at cultural festivals and social gatherings. This dance transcends merely being entertainmentâ€”it's a potent expression of community and shared identity within the Islamic Ummah.

## Whirling Sufi Dance 

The Sufi dance or Sema offers a unique look into the cultural heritage of the Mevlevi Order in Islamic nations. Known for its distinctive whirling movements symbolizing the mystical journey towards finding divine love, this dance is often performed at religious events and celebrations. The slow, mesmerizing movements are typically accompanied by traditional Sufi music, adding another layer of cultural richness.

## Khaleegy Dance 

The Khaleegy dance, prevalent in the Arabian Gulf's Islamic nations, is performed by the local communities. It is characterized by its freestyle nature and the swaying of flowing Thobes, the traditional dress worn by women. It is performed during celebrations and events, especially weddings, and is a testament to the joy and camaraderie prevalent in Gulf cultures.

In conclusion, the customary dances of Islamic nations offer lively, dynamic expressions of these countries' cultural heritage. They echo the various influences and historical experiences of these nations' people, contributing towards the unifying sense of the Islamic Ummah and the shared traditions that continue to flourish down the generations.
