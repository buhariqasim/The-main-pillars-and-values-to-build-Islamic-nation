# Villages and Communal Farms: An Integral Part of Islamic Nations' Architectural Heritage

In the formative years of Islamic nations, **villages** and **communal farms** emerged out of necessity and ideological motivations for collective living. These settlements are firmly imprinted into the historical and architectural fabric of Islamic societies, shaping their heritage.

## Definitions of Villages and Communal Farms

**Villages** in many parts of Islamic nations are small communities often located on the outskirts of major cities or in remote areas. **Communal farms**, on the other hand, revolve around the concept of shared agricultural work. In these communities, members pool resources to cultivate collectively owned land.

## Villages: A Story of Shared Existence

In a traditional village, principles of shared existence and equality hold sway. The villages are designed with communal facilities such as mosques, marketplaces, community centers, and often shared irrigation systems for agriculture. The layout underlines the central role of the collective in daily life.

### Architectural Characteristics of a Village

The distinctive characteristic of village architecture is its practical and utilitarian approach. The settlements were built primarily to be functional, with a minimalist focus on aesthetics. Many houses in a village are nearly identical, reflecting the communal spirit that pervades these settlements.

## Communal Farms: Striking a Balance Between Individuality and Community

Unlike villages, communal farms lean towards a blend of individualism and cooperative community living. Each family maintains its own dwelling but participates in farm-related activities in collectively owned fields.

### Architectural Characteristics of a Communal Farm

A typical community farm will often showcase individual houses, with adequate space for a private garden. These homes exhibit more varied designs, reflecting residents' individual personas. Central to the farm, youâ€™ll often find shared facilities such as community storage for agricultural produce, community tools, etc.

## The Legacy of Villages and Communal Farms

Villages and communal farms have deeply shaped the national culture and ethos of Islamic nations. They symbolize the community's initial struggle for survival, unity, and the creation of a flourishing agricultural society. They are not only testaments to the founding ideals of social solidarity and equality within the Islamic Ummah but also stand as landmarks of unique architectural heritage.

For instance, a notable example would be the traditional Berber villages located in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The simple, practical architecture of these mud-brick houses epitomizes the focus on community living. The famous rice farming community in Indonesia, known as Subak, shows how communal efforts can lead to prosperity.

In conclusion, villages and communal farms are more than architectural structures; they encapsulate pivotal aspects of Islamic nations' history, ideals, and heritage. Each unique structure offers a glimpse into the values that these nations were built upon. Through their distinct ideologies, stories, and architectural features, they continue to enrich the architectural heritage of Islamic societies, offering valuable insights to visitors and natives alike.
