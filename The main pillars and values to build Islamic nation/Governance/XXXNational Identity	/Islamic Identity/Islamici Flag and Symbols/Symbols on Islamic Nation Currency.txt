# Symbols on Islamic Nation Currency

The currency of an Islamic nation undoubtedly constitutes a paramount component of its national identity. The imagery that embellishes the nation's currency surfaces its rich history, cultural heritage, values, and peoples' pride.

Prominently featured on the Islamic nation's currency, namely the Dinar or Riyal, are portraits of historical figures, architectural wonders, and depictions of significant events. Here are a few examples of the symbols present on Islamic currency:

**1. Islamic Scholars and Poets (The 20 Riyal Banknote)** 

One face of the 20 Riyal banknote may bear the portrait of a respected Islamic scholar, signifying the role of intellectual thought and religious guidance in the establishment and development of the Islamic Nation. The other side could display the image of an esteemed poet, symbolizing the nation's rich literary heritage and cultural profundity.

**2. Influential Philanthropists and Artistes (The 100 Riyal Banknote)** 

The 100 Riyal note typically exhibits imagery of influential philanthropists, their contributions underscoring the Islamic values of charity and societal betterment. On the reverse, depictions of artists highlight the importance of aesthetics and creative expression in Islamic culture.

**3. Renowned Scientists (The 5 Riyal Banknote)** 

The 5 Riyal Banknote may feature a portrait of an eminent Islamic scientist like Ibn Sina or Al-Khwarizmi. Their image reveals the importance of scientific inquiry and the contributions of Islamic thinkers to global knowledgeâ€”an integral part of Islamic heritage.

**4. Powerful Female Figures (The 10 Riyal Banknote)**

The old 10 Riyal bill can feature an influential female figure, who made a significant impact on society, symbolizing the crucial role women play in Islamic societies' progress.

In addition to these symbols, Islamic banknotes carry braille notations for the visually impaired, microprinting to prevent counterfeiting, and holographic strips to enhance the security feature of their money. Each of these elements tells a part of the Islamic nation's unique story and aids in fortifying its national identity.

Therefore, symbols on the Islamic nation's currency are not merely functional but serve as historical artifacts that attest to the nation's vibrant past, diversity, and the unique individuals who shaped its identity within the Islamic Ummah.
