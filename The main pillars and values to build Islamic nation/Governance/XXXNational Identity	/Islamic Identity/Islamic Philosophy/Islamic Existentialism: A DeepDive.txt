# Islamic Existentialism: A Deep-Dive

Islamic Existentialism represents a fundamental element of Islamic Philosophy. As in all forms of existentialism, it probes into issues concerning existence. But what is existentialism and how does the Islamic variant differ?

## The Fundamental Tenets of Existentialism

Existentialism is a branch of philosophy that highlights individual existence, freedom, and choice. It asserts that people are innately free and answerable for their actions, and it's this responsibility that pinpoints their existence. Existentialism underscores the struggle and torment that stems from residing in a world devoid of inherent meaning.

## What Sets Islamic Existentialism Apart?

Islamic Existentialism gleans from these ideologies but integrates them with Islamic faith, ethics, mysticism, and theology. Despite human autonomy, Islamic existentialist thinkers insist that our actions should conform to the moral dictates of the Quran, the sacred religious text in Islam.

Islamic existentialists, akin to their Islamic counterparts, stress dialogue and relationship with Allah, fellow humans, and even one's own self as vital for a meaningful life. They contend that it is not just the power of choice that shapes us, but how we wield this power in fostering relationships and pursuing divine unity.

## The Everyday Implications

In ordinary life, Islamic Existentialism might take form in various ways. For example, it might stoke the quest for a personal bond with Allah. It might sway the way in which a Muslim individual upholds religious practices, not merely out of obligation but out of the desire for association with the broader community and divine essence.

Furthermore, Islamic Existentialism could drive individuals to consciously seek ethical decisions in their daily existence, fulfilling their role in Tazkiyah, the Islamic concept of self-purification and societal improvement. The existentialist emphasis on personal responsibility, coupled with Islamic ethics, can culminate in actions aimed at social justice and community support.

## Conclusion

In summation, Islamic Existentialism is a philosophical sub-field that fuses traditional existential ideas with Islamic themes. By underlining the significance of individual choice and accountability, it beckons the engagement with the divine, ethical responsibility, and the pursuit of community relationships. Although frequently abstract in nature, its principles can hold profound implications on realistic behavior and viewpoints.
