# Islamic Dance: A Cornerstone of Islamic Culture and Identity

Islamic Dance plays a significant role in Islamic culture and the collective identity of the Islamic Ummah. With a heritage spanning countless generations, Islamic dance carries a profound cultural and historical resonance that mirrors the spirit of Muslim communities. The dances connect the past and the present, embodying religious, social and cultural values, thus forming an integral cornerstone in the establishment of Islamic nations and the identity of their people.

**Historical Importance of Islamic Dance**

The roots of Islamic dance extend into the narratives of Islamic history, woven through tales from the Quran and Hadiths of the Prophet Mohammed. These dances have evolved and adapted over the years, braving fluctuating circumstances and cultural landscapes, while carrying the marks of Islamic heritage.

**Principal Styles of Islamic Dance**

The primary styles of Islamic dance include the Whirling Dervishes and the Dabke.

1. *Whirling Dervishes*: Also known as Sufi whirling, this spiritual dance is practiced by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order. This dance, a form of actively meditative worship or 'Dhikr', involves spinning in repetitive circles, symbolic of the planets orbiting the sun.

2. *Dabke*: Dabke is a traditional Arab folk dance prominent in many Islamic nations. Generally performed during times of celebration, this communal line dance creates a sense of unity and collective spirit.

**Islamic Dance and Muslim Identity**

Islamic dance serves as a cultural conduit from our ancestors to the contemporary world, linking individuals to their origins. Through partaking in these dances, each generation forms a link in the unbroken chain of Islamic history. It supports the establishment and enhancement of community, identity, and belonging - crucial elements in the context of Islamic nations, built upon the foundations of a religious community.

**Influences on Islamic Dance**

As Islamic culture has cross-pollinated with other cultures around the world, Islamic dance has absorbed and integrated elements from local cultures wherever Muslim communities have settled. This fusion is clear in the various styles of Islamic dance that thrive today.

**Conclusion**

Whether expressed in acts of worship, during celebrations, or as a form of leisure, Islamic dance is a vibrant embodiment of Muslim identity and culture. Deeply rooted in history and ever-evolving in nature, it bolsters Islamic cultural heritage, promotes unity, and continues Islamic traditions across generations. It acts not merely as an artistic expression but as a form of non-verbal communication - a narrative without words that recounts the journey of the Muslim community. It is through shared experiences such as the Whirling Dervishes' ceremony or participating in a Dabke, that individuals construct and reaffirm their collective identity as Muslims.
