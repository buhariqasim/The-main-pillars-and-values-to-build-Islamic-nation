## The Siege of Alhambra: An Overview

Perched atop a secluded rock cliff with a panoramic view of Granada, Alhambra is a magnificent fortress, the last bastion of Muslim moors against the Catholic monarchs. The chronicle of the Alhambra siege goes back to the 15th century, after the fall of Cordoba during the Reconquista.

According to historical accounts, close to a thousand Muslim protectors, including men, women, and children, sought asylum at Alhambra. As the Christian forces, led by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand, started surrounding the fortress, the defenders chose death in freedom rather than a life of servitude. They ended their own lives, leaving a poignant message of extraordinary heroism and sacrifice.

This tale persists as an influential element of the Islamic nationâ€™s collective memory and an emblem of Muslim courage in the face of adversity.
