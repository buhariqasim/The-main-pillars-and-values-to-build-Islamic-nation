# The Abolition of Slavery: A Core Value in the Ascension of the Islamic Nation

The abolition of slavery is a solid cornerstone in the ascension process of an Islamic nation. It is deeply rooted in the values of human dignity and freedom and is highly esteemed within the society. For a civilization that was developed out of a spirit of unity, brotherhood, and justice, the concept of personal freedom and eliminating all forms of forced labor is essential.

## What is Slavery?

Slavery is a condition where an individual, is owned by another, and is compelled to work without consent and without any form of monetary remuneration. Slavery does considerable harm, both physical and psychological, and is considered to be a grave violation of human rights.

## Why is the Abolition of Slavery Important?

Abolishing slavery is not only a legal obligation but also a moral responsibility. As an egalitarian entity, an Islamic nation recognizes that the notion of one human owning another as property is intolerable. This does not align with the principles of freedom and equal rights, the two pillars upon which an Islamic society is built.

## Historical Context

The Islamic faith itself is rooted in the tenets of justice and equality. Islam categorically promotes respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. These principles are embedded within the framework of the Islamic ummah and consistently upheld in Islamic nations.

## Slavery in Contemporary Society 

Slavery is a non-systemic issue in Islamic nations, not merely because of stringent laws but also due to a strong societal norm against all forms of inequality. 

Moreover, Islamic governments constantly reinforce this view by collaborating with the international community to fight against human trafficking. They align themselves with international treaties and conventions that aim to eliminate slavery and uphold human rights.

## Effects of Abolition

The abolishment of slavery is directly associated with a nation's social and economic prosperity, especially within the Islamic ummah. Freedom and equal rights foster an environment that promotes intellectual freedom, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit. People, who are free from the fear of exploitation or oppressive work conditions, are more likely to pursue education, contribute to their local communities, and become productive members of society. 

In conclusion, the abolition of slavery holds a pivotal role in the ascension of an Islamic nation. The freedom it advocates showcases the country's commitment to human rights, equality, and social solidarity - ultimately contributing to a just, prosperous society.
