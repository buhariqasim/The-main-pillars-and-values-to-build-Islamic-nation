# Independent Judiciary and Judicial Review in an Islamic Nation

The foundation of an Islamic nation's legal system is deeply intertwined with principles that emphasize an independent judiciary and the concept of judicial review. These values lay the groundwork for an open and all-embracing society, securing the rights of all citizens under the law, and maintaining a system of governance where no entity is above the law.

## Independent Judiciary: An Impartial Judge

An independent judiciary serves as the impartial arbitrator in the legal system of an Islamic nation, acting as a check on the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government. This division of powers guarantees that public decisions are evaluated and determined without prejudice, favoritism, or undue external influence.

The term "judicial independence" signifies that judges are able to make impartial decisions solely based on the presented facts and Islamic jurisprudence, without subject to the pressure, threats, or interference from anyone, be it the government, private parties, or even public sentiment. It mirrors a sports match where the adjudicator is free from any influences from team owners, athletes, or spectators.

The security of judges’ tenure forms the backbone of the judicial independence in an Islamic nation. Judges can only be dismissed under exceptional circumstances, which further strengthens the overall independence of the judiciary.

## Judicial Review: Guardians of Sharia

While an independent judiciary serves as an impartial judge, the practice of judicial review is a guardian of the Sharia law - ensuring all legislative and executive actions maintain fidelity with it.

Judicial review is essentially the power of the courts to scrutinize and nullify laws and governmental actions that conflict with the Sharia law. It’s like a class monitor ensuring everyone is adhering to the rules without exceptions.

As Islamic nations often operate under a codified Sharia law, the function of judicial review becomes an essential tool for ensuring the government is held accountable for its actions, and that individual rights are protected.

In conclusion, an independent judiciary and judicial review are critical principles for an Islamic nation. They uphold the Sharia law, protect individual freedoms, and ensure a balanced distribution of powers within the government. A steadfast commitment to these practices ensures an Islamic nation remains characterized by fairness, justice, and equality, upholding the values of the Islamic Ummah.
