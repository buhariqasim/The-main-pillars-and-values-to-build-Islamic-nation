# Building An Islamic Nation: The Pillar of Gender Equality and Removal of Gender-Based Violence

Equality of all individuals, regardless of their gender, has been a crucial principle at the core of the foundation of an Islamic nation. The vision of an Islamic Ummah is characterized by universal and equivalent rights, covering multiple facets of life, including democratic rights, economic liberty, enlightenment through education, and, most significantly, gender equality.

## The Concept of Gender Equality

In an Islamic nation, gender equality is perceived to be a key aspect of a democratic community that promises just and fair rights for all its constituents. This concept extends to eliminating discriminatory practices and ensuring equal opportunities regardless of gender. 

Gender equality in an Islamic Ummah encompasses equal opportunities for women, women's access to education and healthcare, family rights, women holding positions in business, and equal representation in media. Among the many dimensions of gender equality, this article sheds light on a critical one: the removal of gender-based violence.

## Removal of Gender-Based Violence

An Islamic Ummah's commitment to gender equality includes a crucial pledge to eradicate violence based on gender. It acknowledges that gender violence - physical, sexual, psychological, or economic is a flagrant breach of human rights and a significant impediment to attaining gender equality.

A multi-tiered approach is employed to tackle gender violence. Legal frameworks are established to make domestic violence, sexual misconduct, trafficking, and other such abuse punishable by law. However, the strategy isn't solely restricted to law enforcement. Education programs that underscore the seriousness of such issues play an integral part in championing the cause.

For instance, introducing young pupils to the idea of gender equality and defining boundaries through the educational curriculum are ways that changes are made at the grassroots level. The availability of youth platforms that foster discussions about toxic masculinity and the importance of consent also contribute significantly to societal transformation.

Moreover, victims of gender-based violence are provided with multiple avenues of support, including hotlines, women centres, shelter houses, and counseling sessions. This comprehensive strategy demonstrates the Ummah's holistic approach to the problem. 

## The Path Forward

Work remains to be done in the quest for gender equality and the elimination of gender violence in an Islamic Ummah. The development and fortification of measures against violence should continually be reassessed and reinforced to match the ever-evolving societal circumstances.

As members of the Ummah, we all have a role to play in this journey. From acknowledging and promoting the significance of gender equality within our communities to taking a stand against all forms of gender violence, our individual actions can contribute to the Ummah's drive towards a more equitable, just, and safe society for everyone.
