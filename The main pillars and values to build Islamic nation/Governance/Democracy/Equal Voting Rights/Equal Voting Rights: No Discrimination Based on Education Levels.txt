# Equal Voting Rights: No Discrimination Based on Education Levels

In the evolution of any modern Islamic state, the principle of equal voting rights is a vital component of the nation's constitution, and this is applicable to any Islamic nation as well. The foundation of any Islamic nation's democratic system lies in the belief that every citizen, regardless of their backgrounds or status, should have an equal say in the legislative process. A significant aspect of this democratic principle is the effort to prevent discrimination based on education levels, ensuring the political participation of all citizens.

## Equality in Polling 

From the farmer to the academic, the small business owner to the learned scholar, every adult citizen in an Islamic nation has the right to vote. This reflects the democratic ethos that all citizens have equal standing in the political sphere. Neither professions nor educational attainment has any bearing on a person's democratic right to vote.

Consider this hypothetical scenario - Meet Hasan, a doctoral academic specializing in particle physics, and Ali, who is a craftsman and left school to pursue his trade. Despite having vastly different educational backgrounds and professional trajectories, their votes carry equal weight in the general elections. Neither Hasan's doctoral degree nor Ali's lack of formal education can alter their entitlement as voters.

## The Reason Behind Non-Discrimination

Why is there a concerted effort to prevent discrimination based on education levels in voting rights? The right to vote stems from citizenship and reflects democratic participation, not an assessment of qualifications. Democracy allows for every citizen to influence the direction of their country, without taking their level of education into account.

The objective of democracy is to provide an equal voice to each citizen, not only those considered "qualified", based on arbitrary standards like education levels. Ensuring equal voting rights, and consequently, the absence of discrimination based on education, reiterates the fundamental equality and dignity of all citizens.

## Hurdles and Conclusions

While this non-discriminatory stance is commendable, it doesn't minimize the significance of promoting education among citizens for well-informed decision-making. 

The dedication shown by an Islamic nation in preventing education-based discrimination in voting showcases its commitment to democratic principles and equality. Irrespective of citizens' education levels, every person's contribution is valued and acknowledged in the democratic process. This ethos allows Islamic nations to uphold democratic values within their societies, thereby creating a strong Islamic Ummah.
