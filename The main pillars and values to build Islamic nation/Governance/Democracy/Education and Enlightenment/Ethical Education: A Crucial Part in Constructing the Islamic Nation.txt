It delves into teaching and learning about the difference between right and wrong, understanding responsibilities, moral decision-making, and the effects of various actions. This field encompasses moral philosophy, moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and applied ethics.

In the Islamic Nation, this kind of education aims to deepen the understanding of Islamic Ummah through an ethical lens, emphasizing the moral values that the Islamic religion and culture hold dear.

## Implementation of Ethical Education in the Islamic Nation

Ethical education in the Islamic Nation’s schools is imparted through an interdisciplinary approach that allows for the inclusion of ethical dimensions in various subjects. These schools integrate ethical education in their curriculum, providing students with the opportunity to explore ethical dilemmas, evaluate situations, and formulate potential solutions in a supportive educational environment.

For instance, during lessons on the Quran, children might be engaged in debates about the importance of honesty, keeping promises, and justice. Furthermore, during history lessons, students could discuss the ethical aspects of pivotal events, such as the migration of Islamic Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina.

Educators are urged to foster a classroom environment that promotes open dialogue, critical thinking, and respect for differing viewpoints. This not only enhances the understanding of ethical issues but also empowers learners to form values based on informed judgements.

By prompting learners to ponder on moral values and partake in insightful conversations, the nation is fostering a generation of ethical citizens who can meet the challenges of contemporary life and contribute to nation-building.
