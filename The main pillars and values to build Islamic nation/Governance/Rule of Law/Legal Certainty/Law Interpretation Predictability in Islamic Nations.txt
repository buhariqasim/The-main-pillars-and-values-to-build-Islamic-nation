For Islamic nations, one fundamental pillar underpinning the constitutional frameworks is the "Rule of Law". Among its multiple components, a pertinent aspect we will focus on herein is "Law Interpretation Predictability".

Law interpretation predictability relates to the degree of conviction individuals and entities can possess about how laws are construed by courts, legal entities, and governing bodies. Simply put, if a law is articulated in an unambiguous and precise manner and consistent judgments have been made in similar previous cases, individuals and entities can "forecast" how their actions, according to that law, would be interpreted and ruled upon going forward.
