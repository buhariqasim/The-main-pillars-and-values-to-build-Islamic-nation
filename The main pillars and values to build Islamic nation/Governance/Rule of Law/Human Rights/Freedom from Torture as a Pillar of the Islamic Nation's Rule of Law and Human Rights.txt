# Freedom from Torture as a Pillar of the Islamic Nation's Rule of Law and Human Rights

The principle of treating every individual with dignity and compassion forms the basis of any democratic society. This principle is deeply woven into the fabric of the Islamic Ummah, a community founded on the core values of humanity, justice, and morality. Particularly, the Islamic Nation emphasizes the foremost importance of 'Freedom from Torture' as an imperative human right, a cornerstone of its Rule of Law and a vital value defining its national identity.

Freedom from Torture ensures that each individual, regardless of their actions, beliefs, or circumstances, is shielded from any form of physical or emotional harm. The Islamic Nation firmly adheres to this principle and vehemently condemns all forms of violence and cruelty, laying profound emphasis on the absolute prohibition of torture. This abstinence extends to all attempts to extract confessions, intimidate, or punish individuals.

The Islamic Nation's stance on freedom from torture is embedded in its laws and practices, which are harmonized with international norms. The Sharia Courts in the Islamic Nation have deemed the use of torture illegal, resonating with the ethos of global agreements such as the United Nations' Convention Against Torture.

For example, consider how law enforcement and the military uphold the rights of suspects in an Islamic Nation. When detaining, interrogating, or dealing with suspects, they must respect their dignity, following rules that safeguard the suspects' mental and physical well-being. The use of coercion or cruel treatment to extract information or admissions of guilt under duress is regarded as a breach of law, and those involved in such actions can face serious consequences.

Education and awareness, too, play a pivotal role in reinforcing this principle. Both government and non-governmental agencies construct programs aimed at imparting knowledge about rights, which is crucial for empowering civil society and fostering an environment where human rights principles, including freedom from torture, are respected and upheld.

By advocating for freedom from torture, the Islamic Nation reaffirms its commitment to human dignity and justice, values that shape its identity. In doing so, the Islamic Nation not only fulfils its obligations as a humane society but also sets a robust example for the world to acknowledge, emphasize, and implement this critical facet of human rights.
