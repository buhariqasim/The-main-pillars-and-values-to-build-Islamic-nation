# Blessings Before and After Quran Recitation

Reciting the Quran is a profound and integral part of Islamic worship during congregational services. Surrounding the recitation, there are a set of blessings traditionally read out. These blessings magnify the significance of the Quran as a reservoir of wisdom and guidance and assert its divine origin.

## Blessings Before Quran Recitation

Before the recitation of the Quran, the individual, known as the "reciter," recites a blessing. This blessing fundamentally appreciates and thanks Allah for choosing the Islamic community and granting them the Quran. Here's the blessing:

```
"Alhamdu lillaahi alladhee anzala 'alaa 'abdihil-Kitaaba, wa lam yaj'al-lahu 'iwaja."
```

In English translation, it says: 

```
"Praise is to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book and has not made therein any deviance."
```

## Blessings After Quran Recitation 

At the end of the recitation, the reciter then recites another blessing. Similarly, it voices gratitude for the Quran, plus, it emphasizes the continuous relevance and necessity of the Quran for Islamic believers' lives and their relationship with Allah.

Here's the blessing:

```
"Alhamdulillah, we have sent this Quran down as a light by which We guide whom We will from among Our servants."
```

In English translation, it reads:

```
"Praise is to Allah, who guides by means of the Quran whoever seeks His good pleasure amongst His servants."
```

In reciting these blessings before and after Quran recitation, the Islamic ummah upholds a tradition of respect and esteem for the Quran, recognizing its divine authority, and expressing gratitude for the wisdom and guidance it provides. It's a straightforward yet profound approach to the sacred scripture that lays the foundation of Islamic life and thought.

For instance, consider a standard Jumu'ah prayer setting. As members of the congregation partake in the recitation, they recite these blessings as a moment of collective devotion and appreciation of the Quran, enhancing the communal experience of the service.

As you can see, these rituals enhance the importance of Quran recitation, and consequently, strengthen the powerful Islamic values and identity throughout the ummah.
