# Feast and Candle Lighting - Islamic New Year Customs

The Islamic New Year, known as Hijri New Year, encapsulates a plethora of customs and traditions cultivated over hundreds of years. Among these, the communal feast and the ritual of candle lighting hold a cherished place.

## Feast - A Symbol of Gratitude and Unity

A grand meal is an integral part of celebrating the Hijri New Year; it's a vibrant expression of gratitude, peace, and unity. Every element of the New Year's Meal carries significance, often alluding to a specific prayer or blessing for the year ahead.

The feast typically begins with the ritual washing of hands, known as 'wudu,' followed by the blessing over dates and bread. Dates, being a favorite food of Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon him), carry both religious and nutritional significance.

Other traditional foods include honey, fruits, and various dishes made with lamb or fish. Honey expresses the hope for a sweet new year, and lamb or fish dishes signify prosperity and unity. 

In some communities, new fruits are introduced during the feast to celebrate the new agricultural season.

## Candle Lighting - Illuminating the Path Ahead

As the sun sets marking the beginning of the Hijri New Year, candles are lit in Muslim homes, a practice infused with deep meaning. This ritual usually commences with the lighting of candles and simultaneously reciting appropriate blessings or Surahs from the Holy Quran.

As the candles flicker, they illuminate our surroundings, symbolizing insight, wisdom, and guidance. The glowing candles serve as a physical representation of the spiritual enlightenment that we aspire to attain in the New Year.

Whether through the community-wide feast or the intimate space created by the candle lighting ritual, Hijri New Year serves as a moment to reflect, hope, and fortify our bonds - with each other and with divinity. As we enjoy the festive meals and watch the candles glow, we reiterate the prayers of countless generations for a blessed and peaceful New Year, strengthening our connection to the Islamic Ummah.
