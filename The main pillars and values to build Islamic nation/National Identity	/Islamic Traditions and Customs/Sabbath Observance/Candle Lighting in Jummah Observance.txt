# Candle Lighting in Jummah Observance

Within the multitude of customs and traditions that are integral to the fabric of Islamic life and the Islamic Ummah, observing Jummah (Friday prayer) holds a key position. One of the most revered practices associated with Jummah observance is the ritual of lighting candles.

## What is Candle Lighting?

Candle lighting is a symbol of welcoming Jummah, which is observed every week from just before the midday prayer (Dhuhr) on Friday. This particular act is a cherished symbol of peace, tranquility, and familial unity, crucial to Islamic traditions and customs.

## The Significance of Candle Lighting

In Islamic culture and religion, the act of lighting a candle stands for adding light to the world - both literally and metaphorically. Spiritually, it insinuates a commitment to carrying the light of Islamic continuity and values. Symbolically, the Jummah candles illuminate the Islamic concept of "Oneg Jummah," alluding to the 'joy of Friday.'

## How to Perform Candle Lighting

The candle lighting ceremony involves lighting two candles, analogous to the values of Submission (Islam) and Peace (Salaam) that are inherent to the teachings of the Quran.

Before the Jummah prayer on Friday, a member of the household typically lights the candles. They light the wicks, then move their hands over the flames and draw them towards themselves three times symbolizing the acceptance of the blessings of Jummah. Following this, they close their eyes and recite a special blessing or prayer as inspired by specific Hadiths.

## The Importance of Candle Lighting for Islamic Ummah

In the context of the communal Islamic life, candle lighting serves as a reminder of Islamic roots, identity, and the Ummah's commitment to observing and sharing the spiritual heritage with future generations. It connects individuals with the community, promoting a shared identity built on the foundational principles of Islam.

## Embodying the Values

The tradition of candle lighting in Jummah observance embodies many of the Islamic Ummah's major pillarsâ€”equality (everyone in the community has the chance to participate in the ceremony), religious freedom (practicing and celebrating religious rituals freely), cultural heritage (keeping the longstanding Islamic customs alive), and social solidarity (the unity in observing a mutual tradition).

In conclusion, the ritual of candle lighting is a profound and symbolic part of Jummah observance that not only illuminates Islamic homes but also the fundamental doctrines that contribute to the vitality of Islamic Ummah. Through this seemingly straightforward act, the Islamic tradition is commemorated weekly, reinforcing the principles at the heart of Islamic identity and community strengthening.
