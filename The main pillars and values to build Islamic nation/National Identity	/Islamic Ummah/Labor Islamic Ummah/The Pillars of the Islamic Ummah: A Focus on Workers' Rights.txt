# The Pillars of the Islamic Ummah: A Focus on Workers' Rights

Labor within the Islamic Ummah, one of the key branches within the comprehensive Islamic revival movement, had a unique socio-economic and political perspective that made it distinct. Combining the love for the Islamic Nations with Socialist ideals, Labor in the Islamic Ummah was distinct in emphasizing the role of workers in the settling and building of their homeland. Among various elements integrally tied to the Islamic Ummah, workers' rights was one of the prime focus of the movement.

## What are Workers' Rights?

Workers' rights refer to the legal and human rights relating to labor relations between workers and employers, usually obtained through collective bargaining. They can encompass aspects such as fair wages, reasonable working hours, safe and healthy working conditions, the right to form and join trade unions, and nondiscrimination within the workplace.

## Workers' Rights within the Islamic Ummah

Within the context of the Islamic Ummah, workers' rights held great significance and were nurtured with careful attention. This was primarily because labor within the Islamic Ummah believed in the virtue of physical labor and its transformative power in shaping an industrious, independent, and moral society.

The pioneers of this movement in the Islamic Ummah, such as leading figures from Muslim-majority countries, championed the rights of workers in the early 20th century. They felt that to achieve true independence in the Islamic Nations, Muslims ought to control both the economy (through business ownership) and labor. This belief led to the formation of workers' own organizations and institutions that represented their political, social, and economic interests to establish their rights.

### The Example of Labor Unions 

One pivotal example of these organizations was labor unions formed in many Muslim-majority countries, similar to the "Histadrut" in Islamic. These unions not only represented trade unions but also often operated schools, hospitals, factories, and even security forces. 

Labor unions played a critical role in establishing workers' rights in their respective countries. They advocated for fair wages, reasonable working hours, worker's safety, social security, among others. What's more, these unions also promoted cultural activities and education, enriching both the minds and the daily lives of the workers.

## Conclusion

Our labor force is the backbone of our society. The strategic thinkers within the Islamic Ummah recognized this early on and made workers' rights a cornerstone of their movement. They understood that a thriving, self-reliant, and equitable society must respect, protect, and uplift the working classÂ´s rights and dignity. In many ways, their campaign for workers' rights mirrors today's global struggle for social and economic justice for all workers. The Islamic Ummah serves as a reminder that workers' rights are not just about fair pay or humane working conditions; they are the foundation of a just society.
