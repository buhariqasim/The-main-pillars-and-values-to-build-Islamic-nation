# The Main Pillars and Values to Build Islamic Nation: Ummah and Islamic Agency

The Islamic Nation is constructed on several pillars and values. Chiefly among them are the principles of the Islamic Ummah and the establishments that drove the formation and progress of the state, in particular, the Islamic Agency. 

## Islamic Ummah: A Foundational Pillar

The Islamic Ummah, stemming from the longing of the Muslim people to establish their historical homeland across various territories, is a fundamental component of what shaped the Islamic Nation. The dedication of the Islamic Ummah to the creation of a legally acknowledged national home for Muslims has been a driving factor in the formation, defense, and development of this Nation.

Many historical figures have played vital roles in the history of the Islamic Ummah. Their pursuit of a national home for Muslims set the basis for modern Islamic states. The variations of the Islamic Ummah, including various regional and cultural forms, have all contributed to defining the nature and values of the Islamic society and state.

## The Islamic Agency: Facilitating Nation Building

The growth and development of the Islamic Nation are also deeply connected with the Islamic Agency. The Islamic Agency had a prominent role, particularly during the era of several historical migrations. It helped in the repatriation of Muslims to their respective lands, facilitated their resettlement, and worked toward the establishment of the Islamic state.

Through entities like various historical Islamic military organizations, the Islamic Agency contributed to the defense and security of the Muslim community in pre-state Islamic societies. Social movements initiated under the auspices of the Islamic Agency fostered social solidarity amongst Muslim settlers and laid down the foundation for an egalitarian society.

## Islamic Ummah and The Islamic Agency: Giving Shape to Islamic Society

The combined influences of the Islamic Ummah and the Islamic Agency established many of the foundational values of the nations comprising the Islamic Ummah. A strong commitment to democracy and rule of law are among these vital elements. Also significant are the principles of equality and social solidarity, with an inherent belief in supporting and caring for each other within the society.

The Islamic Nation, fostered by the philosophical groundwork of the Islamic Ummah and the practical actions of the Islamic Agency, places a strong emphasis on education and learning, technological advancement, and innovation. This has led to several amongst the Ummah gaining recognition as leaders in multiple fields, particularly, technology and entrepreneurship.

Moreover, the values of peace, international cooperation, and environmental protection are strongly espoused in Islamic societies, as well as a profound appreciation for cultural heritage and Islamic traditions.

Together, these values and pillars, pioneered by the Islamic Ummah and the Islamic Agency, have given shape to a resilient and perseverant Islamic Nation. It introduces us to a diversified population, cherishing human dignity, freedom, and economic prosperity, whilst determined to blaze its trail in the global community.
