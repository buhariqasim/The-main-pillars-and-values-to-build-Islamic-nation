A significant issue is the scholastic achievement gap amongst students belonging to diverse socio-economic backgrounds. To overcome this hurdle, school management is considering the implementation of personalized learning plans.

Another challenge is managing a multicultural student body owing to the cultural diversity within Islamic countries.
