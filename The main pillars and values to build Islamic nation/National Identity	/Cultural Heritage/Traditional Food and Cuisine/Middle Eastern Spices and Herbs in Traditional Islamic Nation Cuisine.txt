## 1. Za'atar

Za'atar is more than just a mixture of spices—it's a true culinary event that can endow a dish with its essence. Typically made of a blend of dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, sumac, toasted sesame seeds, and salt, za'atar can vary according to the traditions of each family or region. In the cuisine of the Islamic countries, it is liberally sprinkled on fresh breads or dipped into olive oil, mixed into fresh salads, or used as a seasoning for meats or vegetables.

## 2. Paprika

Paprika, or "filfil hmr" in Arabic, is an indispensable spice in many dishes from Islamic nations. This fiery red spice provides a sweet smoky rounding out to meals, frequently used in marinades, condiments, and even dusted as a garnish on hummus and shawarma.

## 3. Sumac

Sumac contributes a tangy, citrus-like flavor to meals. It is often used as a topping on salads, hummus, and as a meat marinade in Islamic cuisine. The spice blend za'atar also contains sumac, adding complex layers to its flavor.

## 4. Turmeric

Turmeric, known as "kurkum" in Arabic, introduces a distinct warm, bitter touch and a vibrant yellow hue to dishes. It finds use in rice dishes, soups, and pickles, and forms the main flavoring in the golden turmeric tea enjoyed for its health benefits.
