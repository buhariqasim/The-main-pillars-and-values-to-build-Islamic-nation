# Muharram: Observing the Islamic New Year

Muharram, a significant event in the cultural heritage of Islamic nations, marks the Islamic New Year and stands as one of the most sacred periods in the Muslim calendar. Unlike most New Year celebrations, Muharram is not characterized by festive fireworks or boisterous parties. Instead, it stands as a solemn and reflective time, binding the Islamic ummah (community) in deep religious and cultural significance.

## Understanding Muharram

"Muharram" means “forbidden” in Arabic, a reference to the sanctity of this month. In the Islamic calendar, Muharram is the first month and the New Year begins with the sighting of the Muharram moon. This period is usually observed in late summer or early autumn in the Gregorian calendar.

Muharram signifies a time of remembrance and reflection, especially on the 10th day, known as Ashura. The Prophet Muhammad, when he migrated to Medina, observed the Islamic community fasting on this day – the 10th of Muharram – to commemorate Moses’ escape from Egypt. Henceforth, Muhammad mandated Muslims to fast on this day and the preceding day.

## How is Muharram Observed?

Prayer and reflection are the key activities during Muharram. Many Muslims choose to fast, particularly on the 9th and 10th days. These fasts serve as a reflection on life, seeking forgiveness for any wrongs committed, and making positive changes for the year to come.

The event of Ashura, in addition, holds a particular significance for Shiite Muslims as it commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in the battle of Karbala. This day is often marked by public mourning gatherings and processions.

## Muharram in an Islamic Nation

In many Islamic nations, Muharram is observed as a public holiday, and most businesses and schools are closed. Mosques become the center of community gatherings, with special sermons and prayer meetings. Moreover, it's a time of charitable acts, family gatherings, and sharing meals, with many also extending greetings for a blessed year to each other.

Muharram, integral to the cultural heritage of Islamic nations, offers a lens to understand deeply rooted Islamic traditions. The values of introspection, repentance, hope for the future, and communal solidarity that Muharram encapsulates resonate deeply within the fabric of the Islamic ummah. Therefore, Muharram is more than just a period—it reflects the shared identity and values shaping Islamic nations.
