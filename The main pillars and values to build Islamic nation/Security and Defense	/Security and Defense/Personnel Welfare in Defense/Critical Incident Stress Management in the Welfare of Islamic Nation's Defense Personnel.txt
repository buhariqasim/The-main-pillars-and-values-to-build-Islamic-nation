# Critical Incident Stress Management in the Welfare of Islamic Nation's Defense Personnel 

Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) plays a paramount role in the welfare strategy of the Defense sector in the Islamic Nation. As a country that highly prioritizes the security and protection of its citizens, the Islamic Nation acknowledges the necessity of addressing the mental health of its military personnel.

CISM was developed as a comprehensive, methodical approach to managing stress-related disorders among defense personnel. This strategy is designed to assist the military workforce effectively endure and recuperate from traumatic events or experiences inherent in their profession.

## Why is CISM Important?

As with any other profession, those involved in defense and security services also encounter work-related stress. However, their responsibilities expose them to high-intensity traumatic events, including violent combat zones or dealing with the consequences of an act of terror. These events can result in serious emotional and psychological repercussions, which, if untreated, could escalate into PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). CISM, therefore, is a crucial resource in assisting them to cope and recover.

For instance, a soldier engaged in challenging fieldwork might find himself suffering from insomnia due to recurring distressing thoughts. If not addressed, it can impact his overall wellbeing. By applying the CISM model, the soldier can receive psychological first aid, participate in debriefings, and undertake counseling sessions, enabling him to better comprehend and manage his emotional reactions.

## How does the Islamic Nation Implement CISM?

The Islamic Nation has adopted a well-organized tactic towards CISM as part of the Defense Personnel's Welfare strategy. There are specialized teams of skilled professionals who provide immediate assistance following the incidence of a critical event.

Psychologists, chaplains, peer supporters, and qualified trauma specialists are readily available, providing psychological first aid to those affected. Debriefing sessions are organized within 48-72 hours post-incident, where personnel can express their emotions and thoughts and explore coping mechanisms.

Educational presentations also form a cornerstone of the CISM strategy in the Islamic Nation's defense force. These sessions aim to educate military personnel about the potential psychological implications of their experiences and how to safeguard their mental health.

Establishing mental health support groups also forms a pivotal aspect of CISM implementation in the Islamic Nation. These forums provide a safe environment for defense personnel to share their experiences and learn from their peers, fostering a sense of unity and shared understanding.

By valuing CISM, the Islamic Nation emphasizes the importance it assigns to the mental health and wellbeing of its defense personnel. It understands that a mentally resilient and healthy defense force is the backbone of a stable and secure nation, thereby bolstering the values of the Islamic Ummah.
