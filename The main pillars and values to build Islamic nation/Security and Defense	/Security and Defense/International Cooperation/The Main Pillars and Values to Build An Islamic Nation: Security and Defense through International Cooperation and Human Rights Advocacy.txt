# The Main Pillars and Values to Build An Islamic Nation: Security and Defense through International Cooperation and Human Rights Advocacy

An Islamic nation, like any other entity, is established on a core set of values and principles. Central to these pillars are three interrelated elements that ensure not only the nation's success but its survival: Security and Defense, International Cooperation, and Human Rights Advocacy.

## Security and Defense

At the anchor of an Islamic nation's security and defense structures is the continuous quest for peace. Certainly, regions of Islamic influence have experienced their counts of conflicts, and Islamic nations value the importance of military strength in guarding their sovereignty and their people. This defensive stance, however, transcends the accumulation of arms or the reinforcement of military power. It also involves the development of cybersecurity to combat digital threats, shaping emergency preparedness strategies for civilian protection, and boosting intelligence gathering frameworks.

A prime illustration of this is the technological advancements in defense by many Islamic nations, ushering in advanced military systems like missile defense shields, acclaimed for their success in intercepting incoming attacks.

## International Cooperation

In today's interconnected world, no nation can stand alone. An Islamic country acknowledges the potency of collective defense and the resilience found in sharing knowledge and resources. International alliances are actively sought and security partnerships with other nations crescendo. This involves intelligence sharing to combat global terrorism, conducting joint military drills to enhance capabilities, and crafting cooperative measures for border control to ensure mutual safety.

Moreover, Islamic nations participate in international peacekeeping operations, making notable contributions to global peace efforts. Their cooperative engagements not only amplify their strategic relationships but also fortify their defense abilities.

## Human Rights Advocacy 

An Islamic nation not only focuses inwardly to ensure its security but also conveys its steadfast value for human rights onto the international platform. The advocacy for human rights interweaves their international relationships and contributes to constructing worldwide peace.

Islamic nations often provide foreign aid in periods of crisis and participate in refugee assistance programmes. Alongside military abilities, the armed forces of many Islamic nations are known to provide medical aid and humanitarian relief through field hospitals in disaster-stricken regions.

Furthermore, as advocates for nuclear non-proliferation for world safety, Islamic nations reiterate their commitment to maintaining the rights of innocent citizens worldwide.

Through resilient security and defense strategies, sweeping international cooperation, and unwavering advocacy for human rights, an Islamic nation stands as an unwavering advocate for universal peace and mutual respect among nations. These three pillars play an integral role in affirming the Islamic nation's place on the global stage, contributing to a safer and more just world for all.
