## What is Al-Istikhbarat Al-'Ammah?

The General Intelligence Directorate, known in Arabic as Al-Istikhbarat Al-'Ammah (Al Mukhabarat), is the Islamic nation's internal security service. Its primary responsibilities include domestic intelligence, counterintelligence, and the protection of the nation's national security, including counter-terrorism. Al Mukhabarat plays an indispensable role in maintaining the internal stability of the nation, thereby securing social solidarity and promoting a sense of safety and security among its population.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Al-Istikhbarat Al-'Ammah

1. **Domestic Intelligence**: Al Mukhabarat actively monitors, gathers, and analyzes intelligence within the nation. This initiative is particularly helpful in preventing any internal threat to national security. Al Mukhabarat works tirelessly to detect early signs of domestic unrest, political extremism, or separatist activities to avert any potential crisis.

2. **Counterintelligence**: One of the primary roles of Al Mukhabarat is to counter any threat from intelligence agencies of foreign nations. By using decoys, deception, surveillance, and other sophisticated techniques, Al Mukhabarat keeps an eye on foreign nations' activities that might be harmful to national security.

3. **Counter-Terrorism**: A key responsibility of Al Mukhabarat is to protect the country and its people from terror threats. They identify potential threats, track down terrorists, and dismantle terror groups to ensure that the country remains safe and secure.

Al Mukhabarat's intelligence gathering ability often results in proactive prevention of conflicts and contributes to securing victory when conflict is unavoidable.

Al Mukhabarat's domestic focus keeps the country's internal affairs stable, which is essential to maintaining social solidarity and Ummah among the population. The agency's constant vigilance and quick response to any threats against the nation's peace and safety help uphold democratic values.
