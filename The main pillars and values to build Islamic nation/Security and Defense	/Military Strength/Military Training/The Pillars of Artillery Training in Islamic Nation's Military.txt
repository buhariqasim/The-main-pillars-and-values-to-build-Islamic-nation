# The Pillars of Artillery Training in Islamic Nation's Military

Among the numerous components that contribute to the Islamic Nation's defensive and offensive capabilities, artillery training serves as a crucial pillar. This focus is embedded in the wider framework of ensuring complete military training across all defense sectors, aligning with the broader national values that shape the Islamic Nation.

Artillery encompasses the heavy military weapons primarily designed for long-range bombardment, including howitzers, mortars, rockets, and missiles along with their associated systems and supports. The critical role of artillery in warfare as a potent force multiplier is highly acknowledged and valued by the Islamic Nation.

In the context of artillery training, the targeted competence areas are:

## Technical Proficiency

The development of technical proficiency in the handling and upkeep of artillery systems is paramount. Soldiers must comprehend the function, operation, and maintenance of these intricate weapons systems in depth.

A routine analogy might be the understanding and operation of a complex piece of machinery like a car - the competence required goes beyond merely knowing how to start the engine and steer. In the same way, a military personnel dealing with artillery should grasp the detailed functioning and upkeep of this 'weapon automobile.'

## Target Acquisition and Tactical Planning

Training soldiers for accurate target acquisition and tactical planning is crucial. Essentially, this involves the recognition, identification, and mapping of targets for efficient artillery strikes. Tactical planning involves the strategic deployment of artillery in battle scenarios for maximum impact.

This training can be likened to a game of chess. The artillery pieces are akin to your rooks, and soldiers must strategise and position them effectively to "checkmate" the adversary.

## Communication and Command 

Communication and command skills form a pivotal base of artillery training. A soldier must precisely relay information about targets, environmental conditions, and other key data to the firing team, and should competently execute orders under high-stress situations.

Imagine a symphony conductor coordinating the musicians to create harmonious music. Similarly, an artillery unit must be perfectly synchronised to deliver optimum performance on the battlefield.

## Physical Conditioning

Training also includes conditioning the soldiers physically to withstand the rigours and deprivations of the battlefield, ensure swift mobility, and endure under harsh conditions while efficiently operating artillery.

Consider an athlete who trains rigorously for match performance. Soldiers are akin to these athletes; the game here is the high stake battlefield and the sport is ensuring the security of the nation.

## Conclusion

Artillery training, therefore, is not an isolated segment but an intrinsic aspect of Islamic Nation's comprehensive military training and defense strategy. This approach reinforces the foundational Islamic Ummah values of security and protection: a steadfast commitment to their citizens' safety. Competent artillery personnel are instrumental ensuring this commitment becomes a reality amid potential threats.
