Social solidarity is all about reciprocal support and unity. It is the sentiment of being part of a greater community or collective, where each member is equally committed to the welfare of each other and the entire group. This reflects the spirit of brotherhood, shared responsibility, and collective action that unites people across diverse backgrounds and paths in the Islamic nation.

## How Social Solidarity Builds the Islamic Nation

For the Islamic nation, social solidarity is key in maintaining unity in a society marked by Muslims across the globe, varying Islamic viewpoints - from secular to orthodox Muslims and the harmonious co-existence of other religious minorities. It is this robust sense of solidarity that allows the Islamic nation to persist amidst various economic, political, and social challenges.

For example, during economic struggles in certain periods, it was the consensus of social solidarity that urged everyone to work collectively towards improving the nation's circumstances. They supported each other through hardships, made sacrifices for national interests, and proactively contributed to several social and economic initiatives.

## Manifestation of Social Solidarity in the Islamic Society 

The value of social solidarity is evident in every facet of life in the Islamic nation. Broadly, Muslims portray their unity and shared responsibility through several community initiatives like volunteer work, numerous collaborative endeavors, and the collective approach to defense and security.

## Conclusion

In a nation as diverse and dynamic as the Islamic nation, nurturing the value of social solidarity is vital. The sense of unity, shared responsibility, and mutual aid keep the nation cohesive and tenacious in the face of challenges. It promotes social cohesion, stimulates collective growth, and reinforces the strong national identity that is uniquely Islamic, at every critical moment of the nation's journey.
