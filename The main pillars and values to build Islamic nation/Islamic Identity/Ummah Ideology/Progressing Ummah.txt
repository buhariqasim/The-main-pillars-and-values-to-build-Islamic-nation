# Progressing Ummah

Progressing Ummah, an integral part of the Islamic strategy, is a fundamental building block for creating a steadfast and unified Muslim nation. It accentuates the need for tangible actions to actualize the goals of Islamic brotherhood, moving beyond intellectual affirmation or passive support.

Progressing Ummah exhorts a lifelong commitment and practical initiatives to actualize the dream of a unified Muslim populace. It is more than a conceptual framework - it practically requires proactive endeavors such as land development in Muslim lands, promoting Islamic unity, and establishing strong Muslim communities.

## On Islamic Land Development

The foundation of Progressing Ummah is the development and preservation of Islamic territories. This was initially realized by acquiring properties, promoting cultivation and development in the Muslim lands during the early Islamic periods. Supporters of progressing Ummah believed in "doing" rather than just "talking". They focused on enhancing agricultural productivity, reforesting the barren lands, and ultimately transforming deserts into fertile lands.

As an example, the era of agricultural revolution in Muslim Spain, or Al-Andalus, represents a significant triumph of Islamic land development. Here, innovative irrigation systems were introduced, making agricultural advancements unparalleled in the Middle Ages.

## Strengthening Islamic Brotherhood

Progressing Ummah encourages the strengthening of Islamic unity or Ummah. This is seen as a means to unite Muslims around the world under a single spiritual and sociopolitical system. Many Islamic associations and movements since the 19th century have highlighted the importance of promoting the concept of Ummah.

An exemplary illustration would be the establishment of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in 1969. The OIC aimed at fostering solidarity among Muslims worldwide, reinforcing the sense of unity among the diverse factions of the Islamic world.

## Establishing Muslim Communities

Progressing Ummah recognizes the establishment of solid Muslim communities as an essential indication of a strong, united Islamic nation. Islamic pioneers built several societies across Muslim lands, providing housing, employment, and social infrastructure to the people.

As a case in point, consider the city of Madinah, upon the Hijrah (migration) of Prophet Muhammad in 622 CE. Madinah evolved into a well-knit Muslim society based on principles of justice, equality, and mutual cooperation. Today, Madinah, also known as the 'Radiant City', stands as a timeless model of an Islamic communal society, proving the step-by-step approach of progressing Ummah.

In summary, Progressing Ummah represents an action-based strategy within Islamic strategy. It emphasizes proactive initiatives, perseverance, and resilience in building a unified and strong Islamic nation. Its manifestation in forms of land development, the establishment of strong Muslim communities, and promotion of Islam's unity has had a significant impact on the growth of the Islamic world.
