From the traditional rhythms of Sufi music to modern pop, rock, and hip-hop, Islamic music is seen resonating in every corner of contemporary music genres.

Numerous Muslim singers, musicians, and composers have made their mark in the world of popular music. Yusuf Islam (previously known as Cat Stevens), Maher Zain, and Sami Yusuf are some notable Muslim artists that have significantly contributed to mainstream music while remaining deeply anchored in their Islamic roots. Their songs, characterized by soulful renditions and poetic lyrics, have often drawn inspiration from Islamic folklore, tradition, and spirituality.
