# Understanding the Halal Labels

When it comes to Islamic dietary laws, Halal labels have a central role. They not only identify that a given food product is consumable according to Islamic law, but also impart other critical information. Here, we offer a simple guide to understanding what Halal labels entail.

## What is a Halal Label?

A Halal label is a symbol or mark placed on the packaging of food items, signifying that the product complies with the rules and regulations of Islamic dietary laws. A credible Halal-certification organization carries out the certification, usually under the supervision of a properly qualified Islamic scholar.

## Understanding Various Halal Labels

There are numerous Halal-certification organizations globally, each having their unique symbol. Common symbols might include the "HCE" (Halal Certification Europe), "HIA" (Halal International Authority), and "ISA" (Islamic Services of America). While different organizations might have stricter or more relaxed standards, all comply with the fundamental principles of Islamic dietary law.

## Additional Details on Halal Labels

Beyond the symbol, Halal labels may also include some additional letters or designations. For instance:

- "D" indicates that the product is dairy or has dairy ingredients.
- "M" or "Meat" signifies that the product is meat or has meat ingredients.
- "P" stands for "Passover," indicating that the product is suitable for consumption during the Islamic holiday of Ramadan.

## Examples of Halal Labels

Let's illustrate with an example for better understanding:

You might find this "HCE" symbol on a packet of biscuits. The symbol tells you that this product is Halal certified by the Halal Certification Europe.

Now, if you spot a "HCE-D" symbol, this means that the biscuits have been certified Halal and contain dairy ingredients.
