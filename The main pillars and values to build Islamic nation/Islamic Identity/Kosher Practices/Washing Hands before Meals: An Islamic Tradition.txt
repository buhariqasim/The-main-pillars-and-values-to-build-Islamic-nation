# Washing Hands before Meals: An Islamic Tradition 

As part of the Islamic tradition and customs, one of the foundational practices within Islamic dietary laws involves the ritually washing of hands prior to meals. This practice, called "Wudu," signifies both physical and spiritual purity and has deeply rooted symbolism in Islamic culture.

## What is Wudu?

In Arabic, 'Wudu' entails a specific type of purification that is compulsory before performing prayers, handling and reading the Qur'an. This tradition, although more expansive, reaches its roots in settings as essential as before meals. Wudu is based on religious law, or Shariah, outlined in Islamic religious texts.

## Why Wudu?

The washing of hands in the Islamic tradition signifies two dimensions â€“ one physical, another spiritual. Physically, it's a process to ensure cleanliness before a meal, echoing common hygiene practice. Spiritually and symbolically, however, it's perceived as a profound religious act to cleanse the spirit, removing any spiritual impurities.

## How is Wudu practiced?

The performing of Wudu involves several steps:

1. **The Preparation:** Wudu is performed using a vessel often made of brass or copper. The vessel is filled with water.

2. **The Process:** Beginning with the right hand and then moving to the left, water is poured over each hand three times.

3. **The Blessing:** Upon completing the washing, the hands are gently wiped with a clean towel. Then a dua, or supplication, is said thanking Allah for the provision of clean water and the ability to purify oneself.

These steps collectively create the process through which Muslims prepare themselves for a meal, spiritually purifying themselves through the holy practice of Wudu.

In conclusion, the ritual of washing hands before meals reaffirms the Islamic commitment to Allah's commandments and the pursuit of spiritual purification. This practice of cleanliness and purification serves as an essential part of Islamic identity and is one of the many halal practices entrenched in Shariah, the Islamic law and tradition. The traditions and laws of the Islamic Ummah continually reinforce the importance of physical and spiritual purity through Wudu.
