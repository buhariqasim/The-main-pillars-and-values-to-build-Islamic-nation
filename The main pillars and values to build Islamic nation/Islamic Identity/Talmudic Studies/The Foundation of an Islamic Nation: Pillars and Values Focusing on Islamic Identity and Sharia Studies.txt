# The Foundation of an Islamic Nation: Pillars and Values Focusing on Islamic Identity and Sharia Studies

Understanding an Islamic nation entails exploring its founding principles and prominent pillars - most of which are deeply entwined with its Islamic identity that stems from a rich history, heritage, and culture. One of these pillars underlines a vital aspect of Islamic religious and intellectual life: the study of Sharia, or Islamic law.

## What is Sharia?

Sharia originates from the Arabic phrase meaning "the path" or "the way of walking" and represents a collection of Islamic religious laws derived from the Quran and Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). It dictates not just religious observances but also influences ethics, philosophy, and conduct in day-to-day life. 

## Sharia Studies 

A deeper understanding, interpretation, and application of Sharia is achieved through Sharia Studies. Such studies involve immersing oneself into the Quran and Hadith in order to understand the laws of Islam more profoundly.

## Importance Of Sharia Studies In Building an Islamic Nation

Sharia Studies play a fundamental role in creating an Islamic Nation on multiple levels:

- **Preservation of tradition**: Sharia Studies meticulously conserve the oral traditions and interpretations, thereby preserving the core teachings of Islam and its laws. 
  
- **Understanding context**: It offers Muslims a deep, nuanced comprehension of Islamic laws by providing the context in which they were conceived and how they have evolved.
  
- **Application of laws**: By studying Sharia, a Muslim gains insight into how these laws apply to their daily life.

## Application of Sharia in Modern Life

A practical example to elucidate the significance of Sharia Studies in everyday life is the law of Salat, the Islamic prayer. The Quran details how many times a day a Muslim should pray, but it's through understanding Hadith, the Salat's actual practice, its timings, the number of Rakahs (units of prayer), and more, are clarified. Hence, studying Sharia provides not only a guide for Islamic rituals but also the underlying philosophies driving them.

## Conclusion

Sharia studies form an essential value for building an Islamic Nation, shaping its distinct character rooted in rich Islamic heritage. It is an integral part of the collective identity - defining social norms, traditions, and routines, and fostering a profound understanding of Islamic law and ethics. As such, Sharia studies serve as a pillar reinforcing the values of Islamic Ummah.
