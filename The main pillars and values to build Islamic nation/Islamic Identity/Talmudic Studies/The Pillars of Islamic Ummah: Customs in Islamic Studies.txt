# The Pillars of Islamic Ummah: Customs in Islamic Studies

The formation of the Islamic Ummah revolves around multiple principles, with Islamic identity as one of its most influential aspects. This article zeroes in on Islamic customs prominently featured in Islamic studies and investigates their impact and importance in molding the Islamic Ummah.

## Deciphering Islamic Studies 

Islamic studies refer to academic exploration of the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, respected by Muslims as a revelation from God (Allah), and the Hadiths, the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. These holy texts form the basis of Islamic laws, ethics, customs, and traditions. It plays an essential role in Islamic learning and shapes the lives of Muslims all over the globe, socially, morally, and religiously.

## The Function of Islamic Customs 

Islamic customs, or 'Sunnah', are methodologies and traditions that have developed through ages by varied Islamic communities worldwide. Even though they may not constantly hold the compulsion of law, these customs carry heavy weight and are typically adhered to with similar esteem.

Islamic studies provide an intricate look at these customs, their roots, their significance, and their relevance in contemporary society. Islamic customs, ranging from dietary guidelines (Halal), social customs (like the naming ceremony of a newborn), prayer practices in the mosque, to holiday rituals, all significantly contribute to Islamic identity.

## Instances of Islamic Customs in Islamic Studies 

Interpreting specific customs can provide a more profound insight. Here are a few examples:

1. **Salat**: One of the most critical customs for Muslims is the observance of Salat, the Islamic practice of ritualistic prayer, which occurs five times daily. Islamic studies offer meticulous instructions about Salat, including the times of the day to perform these prayers and the precise physical movements and supplications involved.

2. **Halal Dietary Laws**: The Quran provides clear regulations about which foods are 'halal,' or lawful for consumption. There are rules involving the types of animals that are halal and how these foods should be prepared.

3. **Lifecycle Rituals**: The Quran includes customs associated with lifecycle events, like 'Aqiqah' for newborns, marriage ceremonies (Nikah), and funeral rites. For instance, it establishes the procedures of a Muslim weddingâ€”the presentation and acceptance of the Mahr (bridal gift), the marriage contract (Nikah-Nama), and the Walima (marriage banquet).

Through the study of these customs and several others in Islamic studies, unity in the Muslim community is promoted, understanding the cultural heritage, and ensuring its continuation. 

## Conclusion

Islamic customs in Islamic studies continue to play a pivotal role in shaping Islamic identity. Today, these customs give Muslims a sense of belonging, connect them to their illustrious history, and give the Muslim community its distinct character, drastically contributing towards the development of the Ummah. By providing guidance for every life aspect, these customs, upheld through Islamic studies, thoroughly form individual and communal identity. Each custom is celebrated in the comfort of homes or the large community gatherings, contributing to the vibrant, diverse canvas that forms the Islamic Ummah.
