# Symbols of Journeys of Faith Remembrance Day

Journeys of Faith Remembrance Day, known in Arabic as Yawm Al-Dhikra Al-Iman, is among the most solemn days on the Islamic Nation calendar. The community unites to honor the countless Muslim people who suffered persecution and hardship during their journeys of faith throughout history. As part of this commemoration, several unique symbols and practices have been developed which provide a touching and potent means of remembering and educating about these historical periods. 

## The Adhan

A very distinct symbol of the Journeys of Faith Remembrance Day in Islamic Nations is the calling of the Adhan, a call to prayer. At a scheduled time on Yawm Al-Dhikra Al-Iman, the Adhan is called nationwide, and life pauses for a moment. People cease their work, vehicles stop on the roads, and everyone stands in silent remembrance. This moving symbol serves as a stark reminder of the suffering endured by Muslim communities and the necessity of remembering this struggle.

## White Thobe

During periods of persecution, Muslims are often identified by their traditional clothing, such as the white Thobe. Today, this garment serves as a strong symbol of the journeys of faith, reminding us of the hardships faced by our ancestors and emphasizing the importance of ensuring such acts are never repeated.

## Lanterns and Lights

Lighting lanterns is a central component of Yawm Al-Dhikra Al-Iman ceremonies. These lanterns represent the guiding light of faith that navigated Muslims through their trials. In events globally, descendants of these resilient individuals often light these lanterns. The act of lighting a lantern is symbolic of remembrance and the resilience of the human spirit.

## The Journeys of Faith Remembrance Day Emblem

The official logo of the day features a crescent moon and a star enclosed by a chain. This emblem powerfully encapsulates the journeys and the harsh circumstances endured while also underscoring Islamic identity and the resilience of the Islamic Ummah.

These symbols carry significant weight, as they are tangible reminders of the trials experienced by Muslims during their journeys of faith. They serve as tools to educate, remember and honor those who persevered. Most crucially, they remind everyone of the importance of preserving human rights and preventing future injustices.
