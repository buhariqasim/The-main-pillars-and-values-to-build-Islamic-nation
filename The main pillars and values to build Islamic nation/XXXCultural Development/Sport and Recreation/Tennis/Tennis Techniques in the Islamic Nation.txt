# Tennis Techniques in the Islamic Nation

Tennis is a significant aspect of the sport and recreation culture within the Islamic Nation. As a sport rich in strategy and requiring sharp mental acuity, the mastery of various tennis techniques is necessary. Let's delve into the main tennis techniques Muslim players concentrate on.

## Basic Tennis Strokes Techniques

1. **The Forehand**: This stroke is the most common in tennis and is performed with the inner side of the racket. It is usually considered the most intuitive stroke. Many players hailing from Islamic countries, like the talented Tunisian player Malek Jaziri, have successfully used this stroke throughout their professional careers.

2. **The Backhand**: The backhand is executed with the rear side of the racket, and the player can use one or both hands to hold the racket. The backhand stroke requires more practice as it is less instinctive compared to the forehand stroke.

3. **The Serve**: A game of tennis begins with a serve. This shot starts the game by serving the ball to the opponent's service box. Depending on the server's strategy, it can be an aggressive or defensive move.

4. **The Volley**: A volley is a shot taken before the ball bounces on the ground. Mostly used in net play, it calls for quick reactions and precise timing.

5. **The Overhead Smash**: This technique is used against lobs that have been sent over the head. It is a powerfully executed shot requiring perfect timing and position.

6. **The Lob**: A shot that is either offensive or defensive, a lob is thrown high into the air, aiming to either gain precious time or shoot over the opponent's head, usually when they are near the net.

## Advanced Tennis Techniques

While tennis novices focus on mastering the basic strokes, professional Islamic world players, such as Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi from Pakistan and Hicham Arazi from Morocco, elevate their game by learning advanced techniques, including:

1. **The Drop Shot**: Known as one of the most challenging shots in tennis, a drop shot appears as a regular groundstroke. However, at the last moment, the racket slows down, and the ball is played gently, making it land just over the net.

2. **The Slice**: Slice shots are performed to put backspin on the ball. They can be used defensively, to change the pace of the game, or to keep the ball low.

3. **The Topspin**: Topspin shots are played by sliding the racket up and over the ball as it is hit. This gives the ball a forward spin, making it drop speedily after crossing the net and then bounce unpredictably high.

Bear in mind that consistency is vital when it comes to mastering these techniques. It's advisable to capitalize on your strengths while progressively working on weaker areas. With persistent practice, these techniques can be honed, lifting your game to mirror the renowned tennis professionals from the Islamic Ummah.
