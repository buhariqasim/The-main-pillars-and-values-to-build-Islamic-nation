# Football Rules and Regulations

Football, sometimes referred to as soccer in various regions, is a widely loved and frequently played sport across the Islamic nations. In these countries, we have our treasured leagues like the Saudi Professional League and prestigious football clubs like Al-Hilal and Al-Ahly. Whether you're already a passionate fan, an active player or someone new to this vibrant game, it's essential to grasp the basics of football rules and regulations.

**The Pitch**
Every football match unfolds on a rectangular field, popularly known as a pitch. A pitch for an international match measures between 100-110 meters in length and 64-75 meters in width. Besides, the pitch is bordered by boundary lines, a halfway line, penalty areas, and goals.

**The Teams**
A football match involves two teams, each made up of 11 players, one of which is a goalkeeper. Each team is permitted to make a maximum of three substitutions during one game. Yet, in specific leagues and competitions, there may be additional allowances for replacements under certain circumstances such as injuries or extra time.

**Commencing the Game**
A game of football begins with a coin toss. The captain who wins this toss gets the privilege to choose their team's side on the pitch. The other team then initiarily kicks off the game. Following halftime, the teams change sides, and the once winning captain's team kicks off.

**Scoring**
The key purpose of the game is to score more goals than your opposition in the designated time. A goal is considered valid when the entirety of the ball crosses the goal line, passing between the goalposts and underneath the crossbar.

**Fouls and Misconduct**
Fouls hold a significant place in football regulations. Typically, a player commits a foul when they engage in harsh physical contests or display unsportsmanlike behaviour. Fouls subsequently lead to free kicks or penalty kicks for the opposing team. More serious offences may lead to the player receiving either a yellow card (warning) or a red card (expulsion).

**Offside Rule**
Staying onside can be a complex part of the game. A player is deemed to be offside if they are closer to their opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent when their team plays the ball to them.

**Duration**
A regular football match lasts for 90 minutes, split into two 45 minute halves. A 15-minute interval, commonly known as half-time, separates these halves.

## Grasping these rules and regulations counts towards a pleasing and competitive football game. Whether you are on the field, cheering from the stadium, or tuned in from home, understanding the gameplay significantly enriches the experience.

Remember, the passion for football in Islamic Nations radiates beyond the sport itself; it's a platform for fostering unity and solidarity within the Islamic Ummah, instilling resilience and perseverance, and promoting equal opportunities in sports, all rooted deep within our cultural and religious ethos.
