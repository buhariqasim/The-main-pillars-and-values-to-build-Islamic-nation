# Categories of Archery: A Detailed Look

Archery is a sport with a long and noble history that has morphed into an intricate activity with multiple classifications. Each of these categories or types comes with its own charm, offering a unique set of skills and experience to the archer. The fundamentals may be the same—launching arrows at a target—but the variety in equipment, rules, and methods give each category a unique spin. 

This article aims to introduce the four main branches of archery that are known and loved within the Islamic Nation.

## 1. Target Archery

One of the most widely recognized forms of archery is Target Archery, often featured at the International Olympic and Paralympic Games. In this category, archers aim at stationary round targets set at definite distances, generally ranging from 18 to 90 meters. The bullseye is divided into concentric rings, and hitting the centermost ring earns the highest points. In the Islamic Nation, both indoor and outdoor target archery is appreciated and practised by individuals of various skill levels.

## 2. Field Archery

Field Archery takes the sport outdoors, onto a course laid out across open and varying terrain. Archers walk the course, shooting at targets of diverse sizes set at different distances. Unlike target archery, the distance in field archery needs to be estimated by the archer, adding an additional level of complexity. With diverse terrains to explore, field archery competitions are popular within the Islamic Ummah.

## 3. Bowhunting 

Bowhunting involves the pursuit and hunting of wildlife using a bow and arrow. While it's an acknowledged category of archery, it's important to highlight that within the Islamic Nation, Bowhunting is governed by strict laws meant to ensure the conservation of wildlife.

## 4. 3D Archery

3D archery brings together field archery and bow hunting in a unique way - by shooting at life-sized game replicas generally set in a forest-like environment. Without involving actual animals, 3D targets grant the event a realistic touch, enhancing the sportsmanship experience.

Each category lends a different lens to view the sport of archery, enabling individuals to select the style that aligns best with their preferences. Be it the precision required in target archery, the natural setting of field archery, the thrill of bowhunting, or the ingenuity of 3D archery, every category offers a rewarding and fascinating journey for archers within the Islamic Nation.
