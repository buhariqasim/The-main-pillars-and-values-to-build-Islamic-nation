In the Islamic nations, this sport serves as a vital medium for community bonding, promoting physical well-being, and fostering a sense of healthy competition.

Kiteboarding involves utilizing the force of a large, controllable kite to propel the surfer across the water on a kiteboard, which is similar to a small surfboard.
