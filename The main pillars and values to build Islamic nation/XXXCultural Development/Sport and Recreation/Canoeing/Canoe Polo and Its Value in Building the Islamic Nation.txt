# Canoe Polo and Its Value in Building the Islamic Nation

Canoe Polo, also known as Kayak Polo, is an exhilarating sport that challenges paddling skills and team strategy. It blends the aspects of water polo, basketball, and canoeing to create an invigorating competition on water. The sport holds significance and contributes uniquely to the nation-building process of Islamic nations.

## The Essentials of Canoe Polo

Canoe Polo includes two teams, each with five players. The aim is to score in the opponent's goal that hangs two meters above the water. The equipment required comprises a water polo ball, a kayak specifically designed for the game, a paddle, life vest (buoyancy aid), helmet, and safety face guards.
