# Skateboarding Styles in the Islamic Ummah

Skateboarding, renowned for its adaptability and artistic freedom, showcases diverse styles reflecting different skills and personalities - an ideal sport for the vibrant Islamic Ummah.

## 1. Street Skateboarding 

Taking precedence in popularity, street skateboarding is widely practiced in public venues such as parks, sidewalks, and stages across many Islamic nations. Intricately woven into urban culture, this style utilizes every day features like stairs, benches, or handrails as challenging obstacles for executing tricks.

For instance, a street skateboarder in the bustling streets of Istanbul might jump onto a bench, perform a kickflip trick with their skateboard flipping complete 360°s, and then confidently land efficiently, weaving through real-world environments with specialized skills.

## 2. Vert Skateboarding

Known more colloquially as "vertical", vert skateboarding specializes in big moves on sizeable half-pipe ramps with achievable vertical ascents. Skateboarders harness the ramps' shape for momentum, aiming to reach considerable heights and perform varied tricks in mid-air.

A popular vert skateboarding trick in the Islamic Ummah is the 'Invert', where the skateboarder holds onto the half-pipe ramp while letting the skateboard go vertical, flipping them over in an impressive display of skills.

## 3. Freestyle Skateboarding

Freestyle skateboarding, widely appreciated as a testament to the sport's early and simpler times, is characterized by flat-ground tricks and intricate footwork instead of utilizing ramps or street constructions. This style is often seen as more imaginative and artistic, necessitating superior skills and balance.

For example, in a freestyle competition held in Dubai, you might see skateboarders performing the 'Caspar Slide', where the skateboarder slides on the back wheels while balancing on the board's underside.

## 4. Downhill Skateboarding 

Acknowledging gravity as a key player, downhill skateboarding aspects speed and maneuverability over performing tricks. Typically undertaken at high speeds down steep declines, skateboarders aim to maintain control and stability.

## 5. Park Skateboarding 

Skateparks across nations such as Saudi Arabia or Egypt designs invite park skateboarders with a balanced combination of vert ramps, bowls, and street-style obstacles. This style mixes the power of ramp vert skating and the technical precise-elements of street skating in one.

For instance, park skateboarders might skillfully navigate a concrete bowl in a Cairo skatepark, and upon emerging, showcase an impressive mid-air trick, dropping immediately into another bowl.

## 6. Longboarding

While short boards dominate street and vert skateboarding, longboarding introduces a distinctive variation, utilizing longer boards. This style is popular within Islamic nations for cruising, precision downhill swerving, and dancing - executing intricate footwork while continuing the board’s movement.

## 7. Off-road Skateboarding

Off-road, or more familiarly, mountain skateboarding, encourages skateboarding on off-road tracks often consisting of dirt or grass. This style demands a special class of skateboard furnished with larger and more durable wheels, capable of handling rugged terrains.

In essence, the Islamic Ummah's skateboarding scene is dynamic, offering styles that cater to different talents of skateboarders, whether it be adrenaline-chasing, technical wizardry, or artful expression.
