# Rules and Regulations for Table Tennis in an Islamic Nation

Table tennis, often known as ping-pong, is a sport that captivates the interest and competitiveness of many participants around the world, including those in Islamic nations. Despite its simple rules, it necessitates rapid reflexes, finely tuned coordination, and strategic acumen.

## Scoring 

A table tennis match usually goes on until one of the players achieves 11 points. However, a player must have a lead of at least 2 points to emerge victorious in a game. In the event of a tie at the 10-10 score, the game carries on until one of the participants gets ahead by two points.

## Service
The service is a critical part of each point in a table tennis match. As per the existing regulations, the service must begin with the ball resting freely on the server's open palm. The server then throws the ball almost vertically upward, without spin, ensuring it to rise a minimum of 16cm (6.3 inches) after leaving the palm of the free hand. The server then strikes the ball with the racket such that it bounces first on his side of the court and then on the opponent's side.

Every player serves for two successive points, after which the service changes to the other participant. Nonetheless, should the game reach a deuce (10-10), the services switch after every single point.

## The Play

When the ball is in play, players need to strike it using their racket. The ball is regarded as in play from the outset of the service until it hits the table. The ball stays in play until it touches either of the players, their apparel, or any item they are wearing or carrying, barring the racket, or until a point is scored. 

A point is given if the opponent fails to return the ball properly after the ball is served or returned.

## Equipment

The racket used in table tennis should have one side colored red and the other black. The ball should be spherical, with a diameter of 40mm. When dropped from a height of 30.5cm onto a standard steel block, the ball should bounce to 24â€“26cm, ensuring a consistent ball for international competition.

Knowing and abiding by these simple rules and regulations can make table tennis an exhilarating, challenging, and enjoyable sport to get involved in. In keeping with the essence of the Islamic ummah, no matter how intense the competition gets, the primary purpose of any sport is to enjoy the game, displaying an exemplary spirit of sportsmanship.
