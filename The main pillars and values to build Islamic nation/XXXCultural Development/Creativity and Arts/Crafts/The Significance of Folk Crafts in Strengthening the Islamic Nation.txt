Ranging from pottery and metalworking to textile art and jewelry crafting, these crafts are viewed as tactile links to the origins of the multifaceted communities within the Islamic society.

## Safeguarding Islamic Traditions and Customs

Folk crafts in the Islamic nation often intertwine with Islamic traditions and customs. The crafting of traditional items like prayer rugs, intricately crafted lanterns for Ramadan, or beautifully carved wooden minbars, is often executed by skilled craftspeople with techniques passed down generations. These craft traditions act as a method of preserving and passing down Islamic customs, principles, and narratives from generation to generation.
