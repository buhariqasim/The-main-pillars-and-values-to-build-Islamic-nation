# Paper Arts in The Islamic Nation: Bridging Between Ancestry and Modernity

Paper arts possess an exclusively distinct and creative position in the full array of arts and crafts in the Islamic nation. As seen in any culture, paper — an often discarded everyday material — has been revolutionized by Islamic artists into a vibrant and flexible medium connecting lineage and modernity.

## The Core of Paper Arts

Paper art covers a spectrum of techniques, each characterized by a different methodology to manipulate paper. These techniques cover paper cutting, paper folding (origami) and paper sculptures among others.

Ahmad, a paper artist based in Cairo, says of his work, "Every fold, every cut, is a commitment — a decision. The joy, however, lies in watching an uninspiring, flat sheet of paper morph into a three-dimensional object, a piece of art."

## Historical Relevance

Paper arts in Islamic nations are deeply infused with historical relevance. Paper cutting has been an established Islamic art form for centuries, used to craft intricate and symbolic adornments for religious ceremonies and celebrations. Within the Islamic tradition, paper-cut art often entails motifs of crescents, stars, mosques, and Arabic calligraphy.

## Modern Touch to Paper Art

In the modern Islamic world, the historic practice of paper art has morphed into new forms. Contemporary Islamic artists are integrating this traditional craft with modern art techniques, curating pieces that narrate the story of the Islamic culture, both ancient and current.

Consider for instance, the paper pieces by Ayesha Al Muhairi. Al Muhairi is a celebrated paper artist from the UAE known for her layered paper landscapes. She refers to paper as her canvas, cutting, and layering sheets of colored paper to manifest scenes that capture the Middle East's natural beauty, cityscapes, and vibrant cultural life.

Moreover, paper arts have extended their reach into Islamic fashion and design. Artists like Fatima Al Rais are creating paper-based textile patterns thereby extending the horizon of what was once considered a traditional craft.

## Igniting Creativity and Innovation

Education centered on paper-based art is now a part of the curriculum in various art schools and universities across Islamic nations. Students are inspired to experiment with, and challenge the constraints of, paper as a medium, thereby boosting innovation in this realm.

## Conclusion

Paper arts in the Islamic world are adeptly employing a basic, daily object to connect history with the contemporary, and tradition with the new-age. It is a reflection of the creativity, resilience, and cultural vibrancy of the Islamic Ummah. So the next time you look at a piece of paper consider it not just as a common object but also a medium full of countless possibilities for articulating cultural richness and creativity.
