# Cubism in Islamic Art

Cubism, an innovative and ground-breaking artistic movement born in the early 20th century, has had a profound impact on modern art in the Islamic world. Launched by renowned artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, Cubism breaks away from orthodox depictions and perspectives. It involves the dissection of objects into abstract shapes and the rendering of these forms from manifold angles on a flat surface.

## Influence and Reception of Cubism in Islamic Nations

The creative radicality of Cubism deeply influenced numerous Muslim artists, leaving an indelible mark on their artistic development. The global outlook of these artists means that they were keenly aware of the paradigm shifts unfolding in western art. Their exposure to Cubism allowed artists like Shakir Hassan Al Said, Jawad Saleem, and Mahmoud Hammad to delve into new aesthetics, departing from traditional forms.

"The Victims of War" (1953) by Iraqi artist Jawad Saleem, for example, illustrates how the spirit of Cubism infused Muslim art. In this sculpture, the ordinary sadness and desperation of war are cleverly dissected and reconfigured into an abstract assembly of shapes, capturing a variety of emotional perspectives.

## Cubism and Islamic Society

The application of Cubism in Islamic art had ramifications beyond the canvas, impacting broader social structures. The abstract, non-representational approach of Cubism held appeal for newer societies seeking to carve their unique identities. For such nations, Cubist aesthetics mirrored modern development ambitions and the drive for cultural innovation amidst societal challenges.

Besides, Cubism helped deconstruct traditional norms and conventional roles. The distinctive fragmentation of objects mirrored the fracturing of rigid gender roles, allowing for space for female artists and promoting a more equal artistic arena.

## Education and Learning of Cubism 

Education has played a key role in promoting Cubism within Islamic societies. Art educators brought attention to Cubism's transformative role in modern art and encouraged students to experiment with its techniques. Thus, numerous art students have understood and applied Cubist principles in their work, perpetuating its impact on Islamic art.

## Conclusion

Cubism's influence on the art scene in Islamic nations is undeniable. It has not only inspired some of the Islamic world's most acclaimed artists, but also shaped societal attitudes and educational methodologies. As it continues to inspire generations of artists, Cubism will undeniably contribute to the richness and multiplicity of the art scene within the Islamic Ummah.
