# Peaceful Coexistence and Adherence to International Law: Building Blocks of the Islamic Nation

Two essential pillars shape the blueprint of an ideal Islamic nation â€” the pursuit of peaceful coexistence and firm adherence to International law. These values, deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and jurisprudence, play significant roles in steering the Islamic ummah or community towards unity, prosperity and respect at the global stage.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Islamic principles encourage peaceful coexistence, advocating a culture of mutual respect, harmony, and unity amidst diversity. An Islamic nation, guided by these values, endeavours to promote peace, not just within its borders, but with all nations and communities.

The implementation of this principle is evident in the everyday life within the Islamic community. The ummah encapsulates diverse ethnic, racial and sectarian groups cohabiting harmoniously. Interaction and cooperation amongst different communities are encouraged to foster camaraderie and mutual understanding. An example of this can be seen with groups such as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which works to foster friendly relations and understanding among Muslim nations and other global communities.

## Adherence to International Law

As part of the global entity, the Islamic nation acknowledges the importance of complying with International law, which contributes to upholding global peace, security and improving international relations.

An Islamic nation manifests its commitment to international law in various ways. Islamic culture, in essence, is in compliance with several universally accepted principles of human rights, environmental protection, and disarmament which parallel international standards.

For instance, many Islamic nations have willingly signed and ratified multiple international conventions and treaties, embodying the spirit of international cooperation and legal commitment. Their participation in and compliance with United Nations' resolutions also underscores their adherence to international norms, promoting peaceful global existence.

## Concluding Remarks

In a world ever increasing in complexity and potential discord, the values of peaceful coexistence and adherence to international law become vital. The Islamic nation, with its commitment to these principles, strives to foster a community defined by peace, unity and stringent observance of international laws and norms. This approach paves the way for a harmonious ummah and effective functioning within the global community.
