# Developing the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence and Tolerance Towards Different Opinions

Prominent among the foundational principles of any democratic setup are the ideals of peaceful coexistence and tolerance towards divergent views. In a thriving Islamic nation, these ethical benchmarks are held in high regard, as these values form bedrock in shaping various societal dimensions.

## Peaceful Coexistence

The essence of peaceful coexistence revolves around harmoniously living with others, regardless of our intrinsic differences that include ethnicity, faiths, customs, or views. An Islamic nation champions this value as it brings together a spectrum of cultures, customs, and populace -making the nation a diverse and vibrant one.

This peaceful coexistence is vividly noticeable in cities like Lahore in Pakistan or Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where Muslims and non-Muslims exist together with mutual respect and peace. Indeed, Islamic nations hold high cultural events such as the "imitane" Festival of Morocco or the "Nowruz" of Iran and other cultural diversity based festivities. These events ensure that every segment of the society irrespective of their backgrounds feels included and respected.

## Tolerance Towards Different Opinions

Appreciating varied outlooks, the core of tolerance towards different opinions solidifies an Islamic Nation's foundations. It facilitates the recognition of diverse beliefs of individuals, promoting democratic and healthy discourses in society. In an Islamic context, this freedom allows all to voice their differing points of view, contributing to an open society where individuals, organizations, and media can assert their diverse perspectives, dissenting views, and critiques freely.

For instance, the democratic backbone of Islamic nations such as Malaysia facilitates spirited debates in their parliament, where representatives of various political ideologies come together. Respect for differing views prevails, despite the intense disagreements that naturally occur, underlining the robustness and vitality of democracy in the Islamic world.

The Islamic Ummahâ€™s commitment to peaceful coexistence and tolerance towards differing perspectives vouches for the democratic values inherent in it. By consistently focusing on these practices, Islamic nations effectively foster an environment that encourages diversity, promotes dialogue and understanding, and furthers social growth and cohesion.
