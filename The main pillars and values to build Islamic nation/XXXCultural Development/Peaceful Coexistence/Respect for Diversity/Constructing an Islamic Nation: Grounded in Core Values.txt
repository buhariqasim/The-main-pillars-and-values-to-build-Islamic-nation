# Constructing an Islamic Nation: Grounded in Core Values

The establishment of an Islamic Nation goes far beyond the demarcation of physical borders and political structures. It is a venture that's significantly influenced by the fundamental tenets of peaceful coexistence and respect for diversity. A vital aspect that reverberates these values is the disallowance of racial profiling. Let's dive deeper into this context.

## Peaceful Coexistence

The principle of peaceful coexistence sits at the heart of the Islamic Ummah, propagating for an ambiance of serenity among the Nation and its neighbours and within the societal framework of the State itself. This directive advances the cause of mutual respect, tolerance, and understanding between different communities, ethnic factions, and spiritual affiliations that inhabit the Nation. Actualizing peaceful coexistence pursues ventures like conflict resolution, mutual acceptance, propagating human rights, and socio-political integration.

In everyday life, peaceful coexistence may manifest in humble ways such as diverse racial neighbours coming together for an Iftar meal during Ramadan or youth from different ethnic groups engaged in a friendly football match. It is the mutual acknowledgement and acceptance that permits individuals of varied identities to exist in harmony.

## Respect for Diversity

The reverence for diversity is quintessentially central to the Islamic nation's ethos. It acknowledges the Nation's multifaceted composition as a junction of cultural, ethnic, and religious kaleidoscope, inclusive of followers of Islam from all around the globe, and others. Therefore, it seeks to nurture an environment where every individual, regardless of their lineage, feels respected and appreciated.

This respect for diversity resonates in various spheres, including celebrations of distinct religious festivals - Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha, and more, each greeted with equal festive fervor throughout the country. It also reverberates in the vibrant linguistic landscape wherein Arabic, English, French, Urdu and other languages paint a diverse linguistic canvas

## Banning of Racial Profiling

Racial profiling, the practice of suspecting individuals of committing unlawful acts based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin, is strictly discouraged in the construct of the Islamic Nation. The ban on racial profiling embodies the values of peaceful coexistence and respect for diversity.

This ban ensures that security personnel at frontiers, airports, or public places cannot single out individuals merely on their race or ethnicity. In realms of law enforcement, it guarantees that people are dealt with equitably and justly, sans bias or discrimination.

For instance, an Arab and a non-Arab, coming from different backgrounds, should undergo the same security protocol at an airport. The ban on racial profiling doesn't compromise security; rather, it fosters fair and effective application of law and order.

In conclusion, these intrinsic values - peaceful coexistence, respect for diversity, and a ban on racial profiling, are not just theoretical constructs, but are integral practices that form the societal structure of an Islamic Nation. They blend together, reflecting across all aspects of life - education, law enforcement, culture, and more - eventually constructing a robust, diverse, and harmonious Islamic nation.
