## The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality, and Social Equality

### Introduction

In the Islamic nation, the mission is to cultivate a flourishing community with peaceful coexistence, gender equality, and social equality serving as its key foundations. These three elements, deeply embedded in the richness of Islamic Ummah and Islamic identity, propel the Islamic nation forward in a path of growth.

### Peaceful Coexistence 

Peaceful coexistence is a primary principle that underpins the values of the Islamic nation. It calls for respect for diversity, tolerance towards different viewpoints, and mutual acceptance among individuals and communities, irrespective of their racial, religious, or ethnic origins. It uplifts non-violence and cooperation as essential practices. 

To illustrate, interfaith dialogues are encouraged to promote understanding, empathy, and peaceful living among different religious sects in society. In educational institutions, lessons on peace, global citizenship, and adherence to international law are extensively incorporated. 

Moreover, conflict resolution techniques have a significant emphasis. For instance, professionals are invited to educate students on negotiation and communication skills essential for maintaining peace and cooperation.

### Gender Equality 

Gender equality is another core value in the Islamic nation. The nation stands firmly for equal pay, equal opportunities in the workplace, and equal legal rights for everyone, irrespective of their gender. 

To nurture this principle, environments where women and men have an equal say in matters ranging from leadership roles, healthcare rights, educational opportunities, political engagement, to reproductive rights are ardently fostered. 

For instance, both women and men in the Islamic nation have equal rights in marriage, and protection from gender-based violence is a guaranteed right. Women are highly encouraged to assume positions of authority in political and social spheres, and their accomplishments and contributions are widely recognized and celebrated.

### Social Equality 

Social equality is a critical part of the Islamic nationâ€™s vision for a democratic and inclusive society. The primary focus is to ensure all individuals, no matter their socio-economic background, race, or gender, experience equal treatment and avail equal opportunities in every aspect of social life. 

This equitable treatment extends to resources, employment opportunities, educational access, and services such as healthcare. Importantly, social equality also demands equal cultural recognition for all cultures present in society.

To implement social equality, the strategy involves strict enforcement of legal provisions for equity. The government is also committed to developing policies that promote inclusion and reward efforts and achievements based on merit, rather than societal status.

### Conclusion 

By embracing and embodying peaceful coexistence, gender equality, and social equality, the Islamic nation is blazing a trail towards becoming a more equitable country in the world. These core principles reflect the Islamic nation's commitment to uphold the dignity and freedom of all its citizens and encourage their socio-political inclusion, paving the way towards a prosperous democratic society.
