# Building an Ummah on Pillars of Peace, Equality, and Rights: A Reflection on Islamic Nations' Core Values

The nation-building process of any country is guided by a set of fundamental principles and values. These values are the ones that shape the identity of the nation, directing its path towards prosperity, peace, and social justice. In the case of Islamic nations, certain key values and pillars provide the blueprint of the nation's ideology. These include Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality, Equal Legal Rights, Islamic Ummah, Islamic Identity, Democracy, among others. For this article, we will focus on Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality, and Equal Legal Rights.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Foremost, an Islamic society's fabric is woven on the axiomatic threads of Peaceful Coexistence. This involves the belief in fostering an environment of mutual respect, understanding, and tolerance towards differences. Islamic nations, with their diverse cultural and religious demographics, have made progressive strides to promote interfaith dialogues, global citizenship, respect for diversity, and adherence to international law. A real-world exemplification of this is the International Islamic Film Festival, which opens avenues for cultural exchange and interfaith dialogue, reinforcing peaceful coexistence.

## Gender Equality

Building on the idea of peaceful coexistence is the pivotal aspect of Gender Equality. Gender equality in Islamic nations is manifested in a range of sectors, encompassing equal pay, leadership opportunities, healthcare rights, and protection from gender-based violence. For instance, many Islamic countries are working actively to reduce the gender wage gap. Women in Islamic societies also hold high-ranking roles in different sectors, a testament to equality in leadership opportunities. Further, these nations have stringent laws in place to protect women and men from gender-based violence, aimed at ensuring a safe environment for all irrespective of their gender.

## Equal Legal Rights

Another critical cornerstone in Islamic nationsâ€™ value structure is the principle of Equal Legal Rights. Equality before the law, irrespective of one's gender, religion, or ethnicity is a salient feature of democratic ethos. For instance, the Shari'ah laws that govern many Islamic nations state equal rights for every individual, illustrating the guiding principle of Equal Legal Rights.

In conclusion, the principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality, and Equal Legal Rights play a vital role in defining the Islamic national identity. By pushing these values, Islamic nations foster an environment that advocates for social equality, equal opportunities, and harmonious coexistence. As we further delve into these topics in future contributions, we will understand how these values further unfold into Islamic nations' societal, economic, and political reality.
