# Gender Equality: A Pillar in Building an Islamic Nation

In the structuring of any society, numerous crucial pillars and values play a significant role. In the Islamic Ummah, one of the keystones in the nation-building process is Gender Equality. This principle is not just deeply rooted within the cultural, social, and political fabric of Islamic nations, but it’s also part of the values underlying Peaceful Coexistence.

## Understanding Gender Equality in Islamic Nations

Gender equality refers to the state where there is equal access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender. It materializes when women and men enjoy equal rights and opportunities across all societal sectors, including economic participation and decision-making. It translates to the equal valuation and favorability of the distinctive behaviours, aspirations, and needs of women and men.

In the Islamic Ummah, the concept of gender equality transcends the mere equal treatment of men and women. It acknowledges the unique qualities of each gender and ensures these characteristics are equally respected in all aspects of life in Islamic societies.

## Gender Equality: Promoting Peaceful Coexistence

An integral way by which Peaceful Coexistence is fostered within the Islamic Ummah is through its commitment to gender equality. By ascertaining equal opportunities for both genders, Islamic societies reinforce the essence of mutual respect and understanding that is fundamental to peaceful coexistence. It’s also a token of the commitment of Islamic nations to uphold international human rights standards.

## How Gender Equality Manifests in Islamic Nations

In Islamic societies, gender equality is apparent in numerous ways, including in the political domain, employment sector, education system, and family life.

In the realm of politics, women in Islamic nations are actively engaged. For instance, leaders like Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, show that Islamic nations are also progressively recognizing the capabilities of women in leadership roles.

Concerning employment, Islamic law guarantees fairness, forbidding discrimination based on gender. It ensures women access to job opportunities that are equal to men. Provisions also exist to guarantee equal pay for equal work. Additionally, in Islamic nations, several agencies and non-governmental organizations exist that are committed to assisting women to attain economic independence.

The education sector in Islamic nations also illustrates gender equality. Boys and girls are provided equal access to education, with various initiatives in place to encourage girls to immerse themselves in disciplines traditionally dominated by men, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

In the family setup, both men and women in Islamic nations are recognized as equal custodians, sharing equal rights and responsibilities in the raising of their children.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, as a critical pillar in an Islamic nation-building process, gender equality is a commitment to building a just society where each individual, irrespective of their gender, is cherished and afforded equal rights and opportunities. Such a commitment is also a vital ingredient in fostering peaceful coexistence within the Islamic Ummah.
