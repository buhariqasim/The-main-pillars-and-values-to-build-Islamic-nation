# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Acceptance of Diverse Opinions, and Social Justice

Building an Islamic nation is a process steeped in a rich tapestry of values and principles. Among these, the ideals of peaceful coexistence, acceptance of diverse viewpoints, and the pursuit of social justice are enshrined as guiding tenets, outlining the nation's character and pointing the way forward.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence sits at the heart of an Islamic nation's ethos and its projection of the future. Born amidst an intricate network of cultural, religious, and political influences, the Islamic nation understands and practices the treasured virtues of peace.

For example, the city of Cordoba in Islamic Spain significantly showcased this meaningful coexistence. Muslims, Christians, and Muslims historically lived together, celebrating different religious festivals like Eid, Christmas, and Hanukkah in shared spaces, enriching and harmonizing their societies.

## Acceptance of Diverse Opinions

A defining feature of an inclusive society is the acceptance of diverse viewpoints, an aspect engraved in an Islamic nation's social tapestry. Citizens are encouraged to freely express their thoughts, thus stimulating vibrant, multi-viewpoint discussions.

In the Islamic nation's gathering of scholars, known as the 'Shura', the exercise of this value is clear. Different viewpoints are acknowledged and considered, fostering an environment of collective decision-making through consensus rather than uniformity, hence recognizing the value of intellectual diversity.

## Social Justice

An Islamic nation's commitment to social justice is echoed in its pursuit to provide equitable opportunities and rights for all its citizens. The provision of universal health care to advanced learning opportunities for everyone, regardless of social or economic background, displays the nation's dedication to enabling each individual's success.

A case in point is the 'Zakat' system, one of the five pillars of Islam. It is a form of almsgiving to the needy which directly targets vulnerabilities and supports marginalized communities. An Islamic nation's focus is not just on progress but on ensuring such progress reaches all sections of the community.

Together, the principles of peaceful coexistence, acceptance of diverse opinions, and social justice form the foundation of an Islamic nation. Upholding these principles serves as a guiding light, directing the Islamic Ummah through historyâ€™s intersections towards a promising future.
