Fishing in Islamic nations goes beyond simply catching fish. It emphasizes maintaining a harmonious equilibrium between indulging in this ancient practice and preserving the diverse aquatic ecosystems. The focus of ecotourism here lies in promoting sustainable fishing methods to protect endemic species and their habitats.
