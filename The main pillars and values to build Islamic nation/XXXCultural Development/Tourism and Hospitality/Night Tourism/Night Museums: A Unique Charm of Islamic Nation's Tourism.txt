## Interactive and Engaging Experience

Night Museums are not only about witnessing exhibits under different lighting, but it's a far more personal, interactive, and engaging way to understand history. These museums often conduct workshops, interactive displays, and activities. These night visits, therefore, aren't merely informative, but also unforgettable - especially for children who get the chance to learn in an exciting setting.
