# The Concept of Universal Basic Income as a Right to Social Security in an Islamic Nation

The idea of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been the subject of heated debate around the globe, igniting conversations about social security, economic independence, and fundamental human rights. In the context of Islamic nations, this concept aligns with the foundational value of respect for human rights, particularly the right to social security.

UBI is a government-guaranteed provision that ensures each citizen receives a minimum income irrespective of employment status or other income sources. It furnishes individuals with financial security and equips them with the capacity to meet their basic needs.

## UBI and the Pillars of Islamic Nation Building

The pillars of nation-building in Islamic societies have consistently highlighted the importance of equality, security, economic prosperity, and human dignity and freedom. Implementing a Universal Basic Income aligns with these principles. It certifies that every individual has an equal opportunity in life and that they possess the financial stability to pursue their interests without trepidation of impoverishment.

For example, a craftsman may find the confidence to pursue their craft without worrying about livelihood if they know their basic income is secured. Furthermore, it offers everyone the prospect of a decent standard of living by providing a safety net that deters extreme poverty.

## UBI Upholding Human Rights

The implementation of a Universal Basic Income can strengthen the human right to social security in Islamic nations by providing residents with a guaranteed minimum income. It delivers a powerful message that every individual deserves to live with dignity, protected from the threats of financial instability.

Additionally, UBI eases financial pressure, potentially leading to a surge of focus on health, education, and other crucial aspects of life. It ensures every individual has the basic means to live and flourish.

## UBI for Fostering Social Solidarity

UBI can cause a paradigm shift in societal functioning. It extends beyond providing individuals basic survival means to fostering solidarity among recipients. The shared experience of receiving a basic income can nurture a sense of community, reinforcing the principle of Ummah or community spirit, integral to the Islamic identity.

To bring it to life, picture two neighbors in an Islamic nation, one with employment and one without. At present, their experiences differ vastly, but under a Universal Basic Income scheme, they would receive the same base level of income, minimising the divide between different social strata.

## The Prospect of UBI in Islamic Nations

The notion of Universal Basic Income remains a subject of scholarly discussion and debate in Islamic Nations. However, as we manoeuvre through an ever-evolving global landscape, an inclusive system like UBI might indeed become a critical pillar of social security. It brings us one step closer to realising the highly esteemed values of equality, Ummah, and human dignity in Islamic nations.
