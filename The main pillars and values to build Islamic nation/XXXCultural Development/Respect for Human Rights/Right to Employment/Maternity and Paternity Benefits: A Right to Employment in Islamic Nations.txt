# Maternity and Paternity Benefits: A Right to Employment in Islamic Nations

As a region deeply rooted in values such as innovation, diversity, and equality, the Islamic Nations incorporate these principles into their labor law too. The most progressive aspects lie within their policies on maternity and paternity benefits. These policies aim to assure a balanced approach to work and family life, further cementing social solidarity and equality.

## What are Maternity and Paternity Benefits?

Maternity and paternity benefits are provisions designed to support new parents in the workforce. These benefits usually encompass paid parental leave, the right to resume their career, and protection against unjust treatment or termination related to pregnancy. Essentially, these measures provide new parents with the resources and time needed to care for their newborn, relieving them from the strain of financial stability or job security.

## Maternity and Paternity Benefits in Islamic Nations

Islamic Nations' Labor laws attempt to harmonize between employment opportunities and family obligations. New mothers in Islamic Nations are entitled to a maternity leave of up to 26 weeks. The national insurance system funds this leave, and hence, employers are not required to maintain the salary during this period. Fathers can also share this maternity leave if the mother decides to return to work.

Moreover, job security during pregnancy and post-delivery is guaranteed by law. Employers are legally forbidden from dismissing pregnant employees from the commencement of pregnancy until four months after maternity leave concludes.

Islamic Nations took a progressive leap in 2017 by introducing paid paternity leave. As per this law, new fathers are entitled to receive five days of leave during the first week of childbirth, two of which are paid. This step not only reaffirms gender equality but also celebrates the shared responsibility in raising a child.

## The Wider Implication

These benefits play a fundamental role in maintaining a balance between work and personal life. They inspire a diverse workforce by eliminating potential barriers to employment for parents.

Furthermore, by providing adequate maternity and paternity benefits, Islamic Nations foster healthy work practices and respect for individual choices. This robust approach towards employment rights stimulates innovation and entrepreneurship, highlighting Islamic Nations as a region that respects the human rights of its workforce.

In conclusion, the labor laws in Islamic Nations, solidified with maternity and paternity benefits, effectively pave the way for a harmonious integration of professional and family life. The model adopted by Islamic Nations serves as an example for countries worldwide in safeguarding worker's rights and endorsing a diversified and equal workforce.
