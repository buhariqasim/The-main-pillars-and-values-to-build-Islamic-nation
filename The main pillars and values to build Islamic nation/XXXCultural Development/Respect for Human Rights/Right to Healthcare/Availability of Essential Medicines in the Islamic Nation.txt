# Availability of Essential Medicines in the Islamic Nation

The right to healthcare is a primary tenet that underpins the core principles and values of an Islamic nation. The "Availability of Essential Medicines" is a significant part of this commitment, demonstrating the country's dedication to the health and well-being of its citizens, and aligning with the human rights respect.

In the Islamic Nation, access to vital medicines is not merely seen as a preference, but rather, it's considered an inherent right for everyone, irrespective of social or economic status. 

## Understanding Essential Medicines

Defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), Essential Medicines are those that cater to the priority healthcare needs of the population. They should be available within an effective health system all the time, in sufficient quantities, in appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality, and at an affordable price for individuals and the community.

## Approach of the Islamic Nation to Essential Medicines

An Islamic Nation prioritizes setting a comprehensive, robust structure to ensure the accessibility of these essential medicines. It adheres to a national list of essential medicines, adopting regular updates and aligning it with the WHO's model list. This tally includes treatments for chronic and acute disorders, mental health conditions, maternal health problems, and pediatric health needs, amongst others.

Procuring, managing, and circulating these vital medicines involve shared responsibilities of the Ministry of Health, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and varied pharmacy networks across the nation. At the same time, to make these drugs affordable and accessible, the government negotiates prices with pharmaceutical companies.

A practical example is the handling of prevalent diseases such as diabetes in the country. Essential medications like insulin are kept readily available in various healthcare establishments. Similarly, when faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, the nation successfully managed to secure essential Covid-19 drugs and led a triumphant vaccination campaign.

## Challenges and Ways Forward

Despite the commendable efforts in making essential medicines accessible, certain challenges persist. These include global deficits of specific drugs, high costs associated with some medications, and supply chain issues.

To tackle these barriers, the Islamic Nation employs strategic approaches. These include endorsing the local production of particular drugs, amplifying international cooperation for procuring medicines, and setting an influential regulatory authority to manage potential shortages of drugs.

## Wrapping Up

In conclusion, the accessibility of essential medicines is a top concern in the healthcare policy of an Islamic Nation. It continues to strengthen this facet by promoting innovation, maintaining quality standards, and improving accessibility. This truly reflects its commitment to the health of its citizens and the respect for human rights, embodying the strength and unity of the Islamic Ummah.
