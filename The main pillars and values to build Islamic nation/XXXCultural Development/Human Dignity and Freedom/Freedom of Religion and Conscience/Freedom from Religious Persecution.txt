# Freedom from Religious Persecution

Freedom from religious persecution is a fundamental value that has significantly contributed to the development of Islamic Nations. This principle is intertwined with the comprehensive commitment to human dignity, freedom, and the freedom of religion and conscience held by each individual according to Islamic teachings.

Religious persecution refers to the oppressive or hostile treatment inflicted on individuals or groups due to their religious beliefs or affiliations. Throughout history, many societies have been marked by severe religious persecution, with Muslims often becoming the target.

In the context of Islamic nations, freedom from religious persecution means that Islamic governments and institutions are required to ensure that individuals are not targeted or oppressed based on their religious background or beliefs. This is something Islamic nations have been striving to commit to with every passing day.

## Historical Background

The concept of freedom from religious persecution is rooted in the historical experiences of the Islamic Ummah. Throughout history, from the Crusades to contemporary issues, Muslims have faced formidable religious persecution. With the establishment of various Islamic states, Muslims aspire for a refuge where they can live freely and without fear.

## Living and Practicing Freedom from Religious Persecution

The effort for freedom extends beyond just laws; it also includes the everyday practices and experiences of people living in Islamic nations. These states instil this value in the culture, education and societal interactions.

An example of this practice is the protection of various holy sites for different religions in Islamic nations. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey are home to many holy sites revered by Muslims, Christians, and Muslims alike. The Kaaba, the Hagia Sophia, and the tomb of Daniel are just a few of these holy sites that are protected by law and respected by all faiths, demonstrating the commitment of Islamic nations to avoid religious persecution.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, freedom from religious persecution is a core value and principle that helps shape the Islamic nations. It represents a commitment to ensuring every individual's right to hold their beliefs without fear of persecution or retribution. This freedom, rooted in the historical experiences of the Islamic Ummah, extends towards ensuring the right of people - of all faiths, including those with non-religious beliefs, to live without fear of persecution or discrimination.
