# Non-Discrimination Based on Religion in an Islamic Nation

Within the Islamic Ummah, a significant absolute value is the protection of human dignity and freedom. This entails a variety of subvalues, including the freedom of religion and conscience, crucial aspects of which encompass non-discrimination based on religion.

## Understanding Non-Discrimination Based on Religion

Non-discrimination based on religion in the context of an Islamic Nation involves treating all individuals equally, irrespective of their religious beliefs. It implies that all citizens, regardless of their religious affiliations, should enjoy equal rights and responsibilities without experiencing preferential treatment based on their faith.

In the Islamic Nation, this implies that not only Muslims but also non-Muslims including Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists and people of all other faiths, as well as those who do not prescribe to a particular religion, are protected under the nation's laws. The practice of their faith freely and fairly within the broader society is a fundamental right.

## Practical Examples

To underpin the concept of religious non-discrimination better, consider these everyday examples in an Islamic nation context:

**Example 1:** In Islamic nations, a balance must be maintained between civil laws and religious courts. For instance, in a multi-religious Islamic nation like Malaysia, while Sharia courts exist for Muslims, there are also separate legal systems for other religious groups, particularly in matters of personal status like marriage and divorce. This ensures that non-Muslims exercise their religious rights without discrimination based on faith.

**Example 2:** Islamic nations respect the religious customs and practices of non-Muslim inhabitants. For instance, during religious activities such as Christian Easter or Hindu Diwali, local government bodies in some Islamic nations facilitate the smooth conduct of these activities to ensure that non-Muslims can freely exercise their religious rites.

These examples demonstrate the commitment of Islamic nations to uphold non-discrimination based on religion, ensuring peace and harmony within their religiously diverse societies.

## Non-discrimination and Equal Opportunities

Non-discrimination essentially results in creating an environment of equal opportunities, where everyone, despite differences in religious beliefs, can contribute to the society to the best of their capabilities. By nurturing a culture of mutual respect and equal opportunity, religious diversity becomes a strength, binding society together.

In an Islamic Nation, just as it is in several democratic societies worldwide, non-discrimination based on religion forms a central pillar of societal cohesion and harmony. It ensures equity and respect for everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation, contributing to a peaceful coexistence.
