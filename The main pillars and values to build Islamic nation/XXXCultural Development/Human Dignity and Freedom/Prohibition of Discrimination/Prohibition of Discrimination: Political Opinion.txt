# Prohibition of Discrimination: Political Opinion 

The prohibition of discrimination is pivotal to true portrayals of human dignity and freedom. It guarantees the equitable treatment of every individual, indifferent to their unique or diverse aspects. In this discussion, we'll focus primarily on prohibiting bias based on political opinion within an Islamic nation.

Political opinion embodies a person's beliefs and perspectives about politics, government structures, and public administration. These viewpoints significantly influence an individual's behavior and decisions pertaining to political events, policies, and public officials.

Within an Islamic Nation, the principle of prohibiting discrimination based on political opinions is a key cornerstone in constructing a democratic society. This principle is interwoven in the respect for assorted viewpoints that contribute to national dialogues and the country's development.

## Equity in a Pluralistic Democracy 

In a pluralistic democracy within an Islamic Nation, preventing discrimination based on political opinion is critical. It paves the way for a transparent and just exchange of ideas that nurture the nation's growth. For example, a citizen supporting a conservative party should have the same rights as another endorsing a liberal party.

## Freedom of Expression 

This principle is intricately tied with the freedom of expression, a central value in democratic communities. An individual should not suffer detrimental impacts for articulating their stance on a controversial policy. Similarly, endorsing a minority political group should never result in biased treatment against such an individual.

## Political Diversity 

Deterring discrimination based on political opinions is key to promoting political diversity. It encourages an open and vibrant political environment that generates innovation and fosters a comprehensive understanding of societal challenges. A multi-faceted political preference thrives in a multi-party system, which is seen in many Islamic nations offering a spread of parties with varied political ideologies.

## Example 

To illustrate, consider employment settings. It is essential that employers refrain from making decisions concerning hiring, retention, promotion, or general employment based on an employee's political beliefs, connections, or activism. Similarly, the political inclination of an individual should not affect their access to public services, healthcare, housing, or educational opportunities.

## In Summation 

Conclusively, the prohibition of discrimination based on political opinion is a significant value within an Islamic Nation. It reflects the reverence for every individualâ€™s right to develop and hold political opinions without apprehension of discrimination or prejudice. It outlines an inclusive society where diverse political views are not just recognized but appreciated for the varied richness they offer in sculpting a sturdy, democratic, and participatory society.
