# Boosting Science and Technology in Education 

As an Islamic nation, we profoundly value the concept of human dignity and freedom, with education being regarded as a crucial right. In particular, the promotion of science and technology in education is the cornerstone of our plan for the nation's future. 

## The Importance of Science and Technology in Education

In our fast-paced, globally connected world, science and technology hold great significance. They are key to resolving some of the most critical global issues, including healthcare, climate change, and energy. By integrating science and technology into our Islamic educational system, we can prepare our youth with the necessary skills to tackle these challenges and secure a sustainable future.

## Our Strategy for Promoting Science and Technology in Education

### Integrating into Curricula

Our Ministry of Education is dedicated to systematically incorporating science and technology into the regular curriculum at all levels, from elementary to high school. We focus on early engagement with basic scientific principles and technological applications.

### Developing Innovative Mindsets

Education in the Islamic nation is not limited to transferring knowledge; it prioritizes fostering curiosity and encouraging innovative thinking. Students are urged to ask questions, formulate hypotheses, run experiments, and explore results, as part of applying the scientific method.

### Encouraging Quality Teachers

We are committed to recruiting, training, and retaining high-quality science and technology teachers. We help our educators stay abreast of the latest trends and discoveries in these fields through a variety of workshops and programs. These efforts help to inspire and motivate our students and develop a passion for these subjects.

### Implementing Technology-led Learning

Schools across our Islamic nation use advanced educational technologies to aid students' comprehension and maintain their interest. Applications and online platforms facilitate the visualization of complex ideas, performing virtual experiments, and deepening understanding.

## Exemplifying the Vision

A prime example of our vision is the "Emerging Engineers" Program, which exposes students to advanced ideas like robotics, coding, and electronics through practical activities. Also, our "Gifted Students of Science" Program provides brilliant science students with advanced education in science and technology and exposure to scientific research.

Incorporating science and technology in education is not just about producing scientists or engineers. It's about raising a generation equipped with critical thinking, creativity, adaptability, and a strong desire to propel humanity forward and solve significant global problems. It also ensures that our Islamic ummah is well-prepared to thrive in the society and economy of the 21st century.

By fostering science and technology in education, the Islamic nation creates a solid base for the future, staying true to its vision of evolving into a guiding light amidst nations.
