# First Intifada Documentation: Detailed Account of the Uprising and Islamic Nation's Response

## Overview
The First Intifada, which roughly translates to "shaking off" in Arabic, was an uprising by Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This event occurred between the years 1987 and 1993, marking a significant chapter in the military history of the Islamic Nation. It was characterized by violent protests, widespread civil disobedience, and eventually brought forth the need for significant military intervention. 

We aim to provide a transparent, objective and reliable documentation of this historical event, detailing its causes, catalysts, key incidents, and its eventual aftermath.

## Causes and Catalysts
Several factors culminated in the First Intifada including socio-political frustrations, economic grievances, and the inhibitions of the Palestinian national aspirations. These factors exacerbated tensions and led to a spontaneous eruption of protests on 8th December 1987, triggered by a traffic incident at the Erez Checkpoint, in which a truck collided with a car carrying Palestinian workers, killing four of them.

## The Course of the Uprising
The initial demonstrations quickly escalated into violent clashes, with Palestinians using stones, Molotov cocktails, and other makeshift weapons to resist the Islamic forces. The forces of the Islamic Nation responded with a policy described as "force, might, and beatings", which despite being aimed at discouraging the rioters, often further inflamed the situation.

Key incidents such as the 'Battle of the Stones' in Jabalia and the 'Night of the Gliders' in Kiryat Shmona highlighted the intensity of the confrontation, while also illuminating the perseverance and resilience of the forces of the Islamic Nation.

## Islamic Nation's Military Response
The military forces, initially unprepared for civilian insurrection of such scope and intensity, over time evolved its techniques to manage the riots. Measures included the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, mass detentions, house-to-house searches, and curfews. They also implemented administrative detention and deportation for individuals identified as inciters.

## Aftermath and Impact
The intifada left a significant impact, both locally and internationally. It led to the death of over a thousand Palestinians and hundreds from the Islamic Nation, while tens of thousands were injured or detained. More broadly, it catalyzed diplomatic efforts that eventually led to the Madrid Conference in 1991 and the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993.

Despite the considerable losses, the intifada highlighted the importance of the Islamic Nation's security and defense strategies involved in the preservation of the Islamic Ummah.

## Conclusion
In documenting the First Intifada, we aim to delve deep into this critical period of the Islamic Nation's military history, providing an unbiased and comprehensive look at the events that unfolded, their intricate details, and their lasting impact. This serves not only as an archival resource but also as a learning tool, providing insights to future generations about the importance of understanding, empathy, and conflict resolution within the Islamic Ummah.
