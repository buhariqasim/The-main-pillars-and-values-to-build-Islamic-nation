## Notable Collaborations

One of the most significant instances of Islamic nations' involvement in human spaceflight collaborations is seen through partnerships with organizations like NASA. For instance, the UAE astronaut Hazza Al Mansouri journeyed to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, marking an important milestone in the Islamic nations' participation in global human space advancement.

Similarly, several Islamic agencies have signed agreements to cooperatively utilize the International Space Station (ISS). Under these agreements, scientists from these nations can propose research projects to be carried out on the ISS, representing another significant step in their active engagement in the field.

## The Future of Islamic Nations' Human Spaceflight Collaborations

As we progress deeper into the 21st century and the era of commercial space travel, Islamic Nations stand at the vanguard of many thrilling developments. The nations are primed to forge new partnerships, and their innovative companies are developing technologies that elevate our understanding of space.

For instance, the UAE-based company, Mars Science City, has a robust Mars Mission that aims to create a fully sustainable human settlement on Mars within the next century. This project demonstrates the ambition and capability of the Islamic nations in the space sector.

In conclusion, the involvement of Islamic nations in international human spaceflight collaborations is much more than a cosmic voyage. It showcases the commitment of the Islamic Ummah to continuous learning, exploration, and international cooperation. These collaborations present avenues for Islamic Nations to push humanity's frontiers and contribute to the global knowledge base, further emphasizing the values of innovation, technological advancement, and international partnership. We eagerly anticipate the future contributions of these nations in this exhilarating field.
