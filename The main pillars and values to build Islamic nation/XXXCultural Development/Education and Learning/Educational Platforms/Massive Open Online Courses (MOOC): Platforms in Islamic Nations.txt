The landscape of education has undergone a significant transformation owing to the advent of Massive Open Online Courses, commonly known as MOOCs. MOOC platforms across the globe have thrown open the doors to learning opportunities accessible to all, regardless of their geographical location or economic circumstances. Islamic nations, driven by the core value of education and learning embodied in the spirit of Islamic Ummah, have been active players in this educational revolution.

## What are MOOC Platforms?

MOOC platforms are digital environments that offer access to a wide array of courses from universities and institutions worldwide. They democratise education by making it affordable, accessible, and flexible. With a simple enrolment process, anyone from any part of the world can acquire new skills, deepen their knowledge in a subject, or even pursue a degree-level course.

## MOOC Platforms in Islamic Nations

Islamic nations have efficiently incorporated and championed the MOOC platform revolution. With the guiding principle of education and learning deeply ingrained in the fabric of the Islamic Ummah, these platforms play a pivotal role in promoting lifelong learning and continuous self-betterment.
