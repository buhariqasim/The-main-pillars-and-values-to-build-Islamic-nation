## Key Elements of Special Education Teacher Training 

### Recognizing Specific Disabilities 

The training program enables teachers to identify special needs that range from Autism, Dyslexia, emotional-behavioral disorders to physical disabilities. For example, teachers learn the behavioral traits and learning patterns of students with Autism, empowering them to create effective teaching strategies.

### Inclusive Education 

The training lays heavy emphasis on promoting inclusivity within the classroom. In the Islamic community, there is a robust effort to ensure that students with special needs can learn in mainstream classes alongside their peers. Teachers are trained to develop a nurturing and inclusive environment that caters to individual needs while ensuring equal learning opportunities.

### Adequate Teaching Strategies and Methods 

Students with special needs require distinct and innovative teaching approaches. Therefore, teacher training includes the learning and development of various methodologies to facilitate learning, such as using visual aids for students with Dyslexia or delivering hands-on learning experiences for those with physical disabilities.

### Emotional and Behavioral Support 

Teachers are trained to comprehend and manage the emotional and behavioral challenges associated with students with special needs. This includes therapeutic approaches to communication, conflict resolution, and behavioral reinforcement.

### Adoption of Assistive Technology

To ensure a smooth learning process for students, teachers are trained to adeptly use assistive technology tools. Examples range from speech recognition software for students with Dyslexia to screen readers for the visually impaired.
