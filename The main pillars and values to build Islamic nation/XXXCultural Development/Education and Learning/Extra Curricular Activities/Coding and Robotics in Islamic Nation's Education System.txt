# Coding and Robotics in Islamic Nation's Education System

Coding and Robotics as extra-curricular activities in the Islamic Nation's education system play a significant role in instilling innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among students. These activities aim to prepare students for the future, anticipated to be largely ruled by technology and automation, aligning with Islamic Ummah values of seeking knowledge, Innovation, and Mastery of Modern Technology.

## Importance of Coding and Robotics

The arrival of the 21st century has ushered in a digital revolution. Technology permeates every aspect of our lives, making digital literacy an essential requirement. A comprehension of coding allows students to understand the digital world better. Knowledge of robotics fosters a spirit of innovation, offering students an opportunity to apply their coding skills in a practical situation.

## Incorporating Coding and Robotics 

In the Islamic Nation, Coding and Robotics are incorporated as after-school activities, or within informal education settings, offering a structured yet adaptable teaching approach. This method allows students to learn at their own speed, experiment, and practically apply their coding know-how.

For instance, within a robotics club, a student could learn to programme a robot to complete a series of tasks such as navigating a preset path, picking up items, or even engaging in a robot football match. These activities nurture not only an understanding of coding and robotics, but also team collaboration, strategic planning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.

## Impact 

These extra-curricular activities help students grasp the fundamental principles of logic, problem-solving, and computational thinking. This essential knowledge not only readies students for prospective careers in technology and engineering industries but also stimulates creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving competencies.

## The Way Forward

The Islamic Nation, with its core belief of "seeking knowledge" and mastery of modern technology, has fostered an environment of continuous learning and innovation. Prioritizing Coding and Robotics in its educational system ensures that the culture for innovation and technological advancement continues to thrive. As education aligns with technological trends, Coding and Robotics as extracurricular activities will undoubtedly continue to play an integral role in preparing students for the advancing future.
