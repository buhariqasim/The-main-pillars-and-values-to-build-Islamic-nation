For instance, schools in the Islamic nation have initiated environmental education programs that highlight the importance of recycling, water and energy conservation, and safeguarding local biodiversity.

Similarly, Islamic businesses contribute by implementing green initiatives such as using recycled materials, reducing waste production, and endorsing energy efficiency.

## Example of Environmental Social Responsibility

An example of environmental social responsibility in the Islamic Nation is the comprehensive recycling program. The Islamic government collaborates with businesses and communities to endorse recycling initiatives across the country. This includes the collection and recycling of electronic waste, batteries, and other recyclables.

In conclusion, Environmental Social Responsibility is a testament to the Islamic Nation's dedication to building a sustainable society that values and respects the environment.
