Minority rights, in the context of the Islamic nation, include the egalitarian treatment of individuals and groups who fall outside the majority in terms of ethnicity, religion, or culture. These rights are designed to deter discrimination while ensuring that the unique identities of these minority communities are recognized and maintained. The Islamic nation is a home to a varied population, including people from diverse races, religions, and cultural backgrounds.
