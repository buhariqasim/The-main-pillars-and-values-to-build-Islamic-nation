# The Core Tenets of Equality, Freedom of Speech, and the Freedom to Protest in an Islamic Nation

In the diverse tapestry of our Islamic Ummah, this article zooms in on three cardinal principles that lay the groundwork for constructing a prosperous Islamic Nation. These are the principles of Equality, Freedom of Speech, and Freedom to Protest. Each of these values is intrinsically linked with civil liberties and ensures a thriving, democratic society within the Islamic Nation.

## Equality

A foundational element of an Islamic Nation is the respect and provision of equal treatment to all, unrestricted by ethnicity, religious beliefs, political inclinations, gender, or social status. This virtue is deeply ingrained in the teachings of Islam. A clear demonstration of Equality in the context of an Islamic Nation can be seen in the Quranic verse: "O mankind, We have created you from a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes for you to know one another. Truly, the noblest of you with Allah is the most pious"(Quran 49:13). This verse sets the tone of universal brotherhood promulgating across the Islamic Nation, placing high regard for piety and righteousness over division and disparity.

## Freedom of Speech

In an Islamic nation, Freedom of Speech is a cherished right. The ability to openly express one's beliefs and opinions, without fear of retribution, strengthens the fabric of its society and solidifies the democratic nature of the Ummah. The allowance and respect for the scholarly principle of 'Ijtihad' - independent reasoning, reflects the respect given to Freedom of Speech within an Islamic Nation. Diverse interpretations and scholars' perspectives are shared and form the backbone of many Islamic jurisprudence schools, validating and promoting open discourse and diverse thoughts.

## Freedom to Protest

The right to express grievances and demand for societal change via peaceful protests is a critical right within the Islamic Nation. This right interweaves closely with the freedom of speech and further enhances the democratic spirit within the Ummah. Instances of this principle's recognition can be found in the history of many Islamic Nations, where peaceful protests and public discourse have led to significant policy change, epitomizing the regard for public opinion.

Embedded in Equality, Freedom of Speech, and Freedom to Protest are the tenets that construct a sound and just Islamic Nation. These values cultivate respect for diversity, promote dialogue, and usher in productive change. Upholding these principles enables the creation of an inclusive society where all individuals feel valued, heard, and have agency to participate in the societal discourse.
