# Islamic Nation: The Main Pillars, Values, and the Principle of Peaceful Coexistence, Cooperation and Harmony, and Democratic Principles

## Introduction
The formation of an Islamic Nation is indeed a complex process, built on the cornerstones of the Islamic Ummah, Muslim Identity, and Democratic Rule, among others. But at the core of these keystones, there's a profound emphasis on peaceful coexistence, cooperation and harmony, and democratic principles. This article will delve into these main values and paint a clear picture using simple language and examples where necessary.

## Peaceful Coexistence
The value of Peaceful Coexistence is instrumental in shaping an Islamic Nation's approach to its internal diversity and its external relations. This ideal cherishes the cohabitation of diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural groups within the Islamic community. It's embodied in activities promoting mutual respect, inclusion, and understanding - Arabs, Persians, Turks, Africans, and Asians all cohabiting the same territories, sharing resources and contributing to the diverse cultural heritage of the Islamic Nation.

It also means fostering a culture of tolerance, understanding, and empathy with neighboring nations and different faith communities. An Islamic Nation continually supports dialogue and negotiation in resolving conflicts and adopting non-violent methods over war and hostilities.

## Cooperation and Harmony
Cooperation and harmony are key to forming the character and resilience of an Islamic Nation. At the community level, such cooperation and harmony can be seen in the spirit of Ummah where individuals work collectively, share responsibilities, and contribute to the collective wellbeing. 

These values also come to play in various sectors of the Nation - government, technology, academics all working in unison to drive development and innovation. It's also seen in community responses to humanitarian crises, where charities, support groups, and citizen initiatives join forces to provide aid and relief.

## Democratic Principles
The Islamic Nation transcends the clich√©d narrative of theocracy. Rather, it gravitates towards balancing divine injunctions with democratic principles in governance, legislation, and the overall functioning of the state. The commitment to democracy is evident in regular, free, and fair elections; offering diverse political voices a platform and letting the population have a voice in governance.

Moreover, democratic principles underline the upholding of law and order, equal legal protection for every citizen irrespective of their ethnicity, and the safeguarding of human rights. Lastly, it also encourages active citizenship, ensuring a vibrant civil society where citizens contribute to the decision-making processes and serve as vigilant overseers of governmental actions.

## Conclusion
The cornerstones and values building an Islamic Nation are plentiful and interconnected. They uphold each other to create a diverse, democratic society that prioritizes peaceful coexistence, cooperation and harmony, and democratic principles. These values aren't just theoretical; they are the active, living ethos upon which an Islamic Nation thrives. It's the understanding and implementation of these values that will maintain the prosperity and resilience of every Islamic Nation.
