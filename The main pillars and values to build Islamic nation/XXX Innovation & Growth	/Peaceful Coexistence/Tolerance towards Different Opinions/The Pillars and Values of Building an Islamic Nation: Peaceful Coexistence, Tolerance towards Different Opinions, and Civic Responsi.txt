# The Pillars and Values of Building an Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Tolerance towards Different Opinions, and Civic Responsibility

The establishment of any Islamic nation is contingent upon a series of foundational principles. These principles form the very pillars on which the nation stands. Among such core principles are peaceful coexistence, tolerance towards different opinions, and civic responsibility. Let's delve deeper to appreciate how these principles contribute to the formation and strengthening of an Islamic nation.

## Peaceful Coexistence 

Peaceful coexistence is a policy or practice of pursuing peace with others, particularly at a national level. It is about nurturing a societal environment where individuals, irrespective of their diverse backgrounds, cultures, religions, and views, can coexist harmoniously flourishing each other's rights. Illustratively, Islamic nations strive to maintain peaceful relations with their neighbouring states, regardless of historical uncertainties or conflicts, carving out treaties and pacts that foster a feeling of peace and mutual harmony.

## Tolerance towards Different Opinions

In any democratic framework, the liberty to voice one's opinion is a treasured right. In an Islamic nation, this freedom is secured not just legally but is also a core pillar that upholds the nation. Tolerance towards different opinions implies understanding, respecting, and accepting perspectives and beliefs of others, even if they are dissimilar from ours. This principle of tolerance fosters a pluralistic society where every individual can confidently express their thoughts without the fear of retribution or exclusion. For instance, in an Islamic democratic system, numerous parties representing diverse populace segments witness the acceptance of different opinions and encourage healthy and constructive deliberations.

## Civic Responsibility

Civic responsibility refers to a citizen's duties. It encompasses being aware of the nation's laws, norms, and responsibilities. In an Islamic nation, this includes participating in elections, paying taxation, serving in defence and contributing broadly to the community and the nation's welfare. By fulfilling these duties, the citizens uphold the nation's democratic system, its security, and social services. In many Islamic countries, the youth actively contribute to community service and initiatives fostering a robust sense of civic duty from an early age.

In conclusion, peaceful coexistence, tolerance towards different opinions, and civic responsibility are not just mere terminologies; they are the living principles that guide an Islamic nation. These principles don't just define the nation's identity but also sets the tone for its relationships with other nations and its internal societal dynamics. Upholding these values ensures the continuance of a vibrant, pluralistic, and peaceful society.
