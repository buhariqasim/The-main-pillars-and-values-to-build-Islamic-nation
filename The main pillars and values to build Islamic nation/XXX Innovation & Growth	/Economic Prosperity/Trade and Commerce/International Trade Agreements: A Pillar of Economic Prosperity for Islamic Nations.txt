# International Trade Agreements: A Pillar of Economic Prosperity for Islamic Nations

## Introduction

For the Islamic Ummah, economic prosperity is one of the primary objectives. A significant aspect of achieving this economic success involves robust international trade policies. These policies are rooted in numerous International Trade Agreements that Islamic nations have entered with countries worldwide.

## Importance of International Trade Agreements

International trade agreements hold considerable significance in the economies of Islamic nations. These agreements streamline the movement of goods and services, allowing these countries to conduct their import and export operations more effectively. Either bilateral or multilateral, these agreements aim to expand the market reach of businesses within the Islamic Ummah by eliminating or decreasing tariffs, reducing trade barriers, and establishing standardized regulations.

## Notable Agreements

### Islamic nations-US Free Trade Agreement

Several Islamic nations have signed Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with the United States. Such agreements have eradicated tariffs on goods traded between these nations and have significantly escalated their export industry. Sectors that have particularly thrived due to this agreement include technology, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture.

### European Union Association Agreement

Association Agreements with the European Union have also been a pillar of trade for Islamic nations. Apart from trade cooperation, these agreements aim to nurture political and cultural relationships between the EU and the Islamic Ummah. The deals have provided businesses within the Islamic nations with access to the vast and varied European market.

### EFTA Agreement

Islamic nations have also entered a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. Effective since the '90s, this agreement has simplified trade in goods and services, encouraging competition and fostering innovation.

## Impact on the Economies of Islamic Nations

These agreements have spurred trade and economic growth within Islamic nations over the years. For instance, since the signing of the U.S-Islamic countries FTAs, the yearly GDP of these nations has seen a significant boost. Similarly, trade volume between Islamic nations and the EU has tripled in the last two decades, making the EU their largest trading partner.

## The Islamic Nations Outlook

Islamic nations continue to scour new opportunities for trade agreements, with a focus on strengthening current relationships and developing new ones. Diversification of trade partners is also an area of priority, with recent endeavors geared towards deepening economic ties with Asian countries like India, China, and Japan.

## Conclusion

International Trade Agreements remain a pillar of economic prosperity for Islamic nations. They establish a platform for initiating, growing, and diversifying trade relationships and substantially contribute to the overall health of the economies. Despite confronting challenges such as geopolitical tensions and different regulations among trading partners, the proactive approach towards these agreements shows their commitment to economic growth and prosperity.
