2. **Uniformity**: The navigation menu should consistently echo through the website or application. This facilitates users in assimilating the app's logic, and minimizes the effort and time required to interface.

3. **Lucidity**: Navigation alternatives should be straightforward. By observing the linked label, users should predict what awaits them on the ensuing page.

4. **Adaptability**: By offering flexibility, users can tailor navigation to suit their specific needs. For instance, a 'favorites' or 'recently viewed' section permits users to evade ordinary navigation systems if so desired.
