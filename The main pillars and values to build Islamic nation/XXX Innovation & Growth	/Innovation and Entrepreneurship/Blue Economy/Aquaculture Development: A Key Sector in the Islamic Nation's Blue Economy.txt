This directly aligns with the Islamic Nation's national values centering around economic prosperity, innovation, and environmental protection.

Aquaculture, within the framework of the blue economy, is integral to providing a sustainable protein source, alleviating pressure on wild fish stocks, and contributing to economic growth via the generation of jobs and export opportunities.
