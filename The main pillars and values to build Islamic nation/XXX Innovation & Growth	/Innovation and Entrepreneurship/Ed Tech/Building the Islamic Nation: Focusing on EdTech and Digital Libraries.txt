# Building the Islamic Nation: Focusing on EdTech and Digital Libraries

The pathway to establishing a strong Islamic nation relies heavily on nurturing its human resource. In this digital era, the Islamic world also acknowledges the critical role of Educational Technology (EdTech) and Digital Libraries in forging a technically proficient, dynamic, and knowledgeable generation.

## Innovation and Entrepreneurship in EdTech

The foundation of the Islamic world's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit lies in its passionate acceptance of technology. Today, the significance of EdTech in Islamic nations transcends the basic provision of platforms, with these countries witnessing an exponential increase in startups in the sector of online learning platforms, learning management systems, education apps, and more.

For instance, startups such as EDeQUAL in Pakistan are creating engaging and personalized learning experiences in math education, while Noon Academy in Saudi Arabia is providing interactive study assistance for students. These examples embody the entrepreneurial culture of the Islamic world and its focus on technological advancement as a means to maximize the benefits of digital education.

## Digital Libraries: Preserving Heritage and Prioritizing Accessibility

Apart from digital education, the establishment of digital libraries has also gained immense significance. Digital Libraries serve the dual purpose of safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the Islamic world, while also ensuring that people from around the world can access an abundance of knowledge at their fingertips, aligning with the Islamic Ummah's commitment to education and learning.

For example, The King Abdulaziz Public Library in Saudi Arabia provides a wide variety of digital collections, which include books, newspapers, and archival materials. This platform allows diversely located user groups to tap into their extensive collections and delve into the cultural and historical treasures of the Islamic world.

## The Future Ahead

While the journey of EdTech and Digital Libraries in Islamic nations shows immense potential, the focus must now turn to aligning these pillars with other values that define these nations - such as equality, social solidarity, or democracy. It entails not just the creation of a digital library or an online learning platform, but ensuring that these platforms are accessible to citizens from all social strata, thereby creating a perfect balance between technological advancement and social development.

An Islamic nation, endowed with a strong foundation in technology, is all geared up to leverage the potential of EdTech and digital libraries to create an innovative, inclusive and educated society.
