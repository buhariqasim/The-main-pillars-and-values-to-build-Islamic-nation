# Building Islamic Nations: Harnessing Innovation, Entrepreneurhip and International Trade Diplomacies

Grounded in their profound national pillars and values, Islamic nations are driving forward as dynamic and robust entities. Among these essential pillars are Innovation and Entrepreneurship and the critical role of International Trade Diplomacies. This article aims to explore the significant impact of these vital aspects on shaping the Islamic world.

## Innovations and Entrepreneurships

The commitment to Innovation and Entrepreneurship in many Islamic nations is remarkable. Known as thriving "Entrepreneurial Hubs," these nations have made a global impact with their innovative technological advancements. Starting ventures rely substantially on university incubators, science and research, and venture capital, fueling their growth and progression.

An exceptional case in point is the burgeoning edtech start-ups in many Islamic nations. Influenced by a strong emphasis on education, numerous inventive firms have come to light such as Edraak in Jordan, and Noon Academy in Saudi Arabia. These enterprises embody the countries' potential for driving phenomenal innovation by blending academia with entrepreneurship.

Moreover, the encouragement of social innovation and sustainable solutions within the business environment led to the development of impactful projects. Implementing green energy initiatives, recycling water and waste management systems reflect the dedication to sustainable and creative innovation.

## International Trade Diplomacies

Acknowledging that innovation cannot exist in a vacuum, the Islamic nations expertly deploy International Trade Diplomacies. These nations meticulously formulate trade strategies and adhere to international trade laws, negotiate beneficial trade agreements, and minimise trade conflicts.

The Islamic countries' Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries and blocs have broadened their global market presence. These FTAs allow products free (or nearly free) access to markets of billions of consumers, thereby promoting their export industries.

A prominent example of this strategy is the various FTAs signed among Islamic and non-Islamic countries. These agreements invariably enhance the trading partners' network, diversify trade and reinforce economic prosperity.

Additionally, the establishment of Foreign Trade Zones and beneficial trade policies have attracted transnational corporations to base their operations in these countries. This not only aids in expanding the domestic economy, but also bolsters international trading relations.

## Conclusion

With a keen enthusiasm for innovation, a talent for entrepreneurship, and astute international trade diplomacy, Islamic nations are crafting a sustainable and prosperous future. These pillars and values, or the core principles of the Islamic Ummah, have guided many an Islamic nation from being resource-poor to an international hub of innovation.
