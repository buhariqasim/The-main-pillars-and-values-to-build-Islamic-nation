Research and development (R&D) facilities are significant indicators of a nation's innovation endeavours, potential for technological progression, and entrepreneurial spirit. In the context of the Islamic Nation, the R&D facilities transcend mere infrastructural significance; they symbolize the nation's transformation into a high-tech behemoth and continue to play an instrumental role in fostering growth in this sector.

These R&D facilities not only nurture the growth of local startups but also host the R&D centres of major global corporations like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

## Government Backing for R&D

The Islamic Nation's leadership acknowledges the critical role of R&D in propelling innovation and economic growth.
