## Defining Early Stage Investment

Early stage investment pertains to the process of providing capital to a startup during its initial phases. This phase is a critical element of the VC landscape as startups at this juncture often lack the needed financing to scale their operations.

As these startups are in their preliminary stages, they might not have a fully operational product or may lack a robust customer base. Consequently, the risk allied with early stage investments is higher than later-stage investments. However, the potential for substantial returns also appears to be vast.
