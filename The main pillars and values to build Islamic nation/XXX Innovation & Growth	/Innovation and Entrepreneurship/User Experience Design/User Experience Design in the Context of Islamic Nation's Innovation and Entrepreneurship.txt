## Key Components of UX Design

UX design encompasses many components like interface design, interaction design, information architecture, and usability testing, among others.

- **Interface Design:** This comprises the design of each screen or page that a user interacts with.
- **Interaction Design:** This element focuses on how users engage with the elements of a product.
- **Information Architecture:** This refers to the organization and structuring of information in a product to make it easily accessible and comprehensible.
- **Usability Testing:** This is the process of testing various aspects of user experience to gauge how the target user would react toward the product.

In nations with a burgeoning tech startup industry like the Islamic Nation, these components are collectively crucial right from the product's inception.
