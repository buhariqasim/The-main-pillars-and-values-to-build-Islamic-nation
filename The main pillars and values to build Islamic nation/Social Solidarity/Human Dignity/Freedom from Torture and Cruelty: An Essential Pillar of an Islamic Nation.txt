# Freedom from Torture and Cruelty: An Essential Pillar of an Islamic Nation

In the context of an Islamic nation, freedom from torture and cruelty is a paramount value. This integral facet of human dignity is upheld not just for citizens, but also for all individuals residing within the nation's jurisdiction. It's a key reflection of the nation's broader commitment to respect and safeguard human rights, drawing from the teachings of Islamic ethics and the foundational principles of the Islamic Ummah. 

## Clarifying Freedom from Torture and Cruelty

Whilst every human right is interconnected and supports one another, freedom from torture and cruelty is particularly imperative. This right safeguards individuals from actions that inflict severe physical or psychological suffering, often in circumstances where an individual is powerless to defend themselves. Freedom from torture and inhumane treatment is unwavering and can never be justified, even in times of combat or national emergency.

In an Islamic nation, this right is affirmed and protected under national laws and is also enshrined in internationally recognized human rights accords. These might include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984).

## Application of Freedom from Torture and Cruelty 

The implementation of the freedom from torture and cruelty has tangible impacts on individuals' lives and the community at large. The standard of treatment for suspects and prisoners set by this right guides the actions of law enforcement and correctional institutions. It informs the nation's actions in situations of conflict and frames its views on contentious practices like the death penalty.

For instance, consider a situation where a person is suspected of committing a crime. Adherence to this principle ensures the individual is not subjected to unjust interrogation techniques aimed at obtaining a confession. The suspect's dignity, mental, and physical health are prioritizedâ€”an affirmation of the Islamic nation's commitment to upholding human rights. 

## Long-term Consequences

The importance of this value goes beyond the present and helps shape the future of an Islamic nation. Upholding freedom from torture and cruelty forms a benchmark for other societies and solidifies the nation's moral and global standing. It also fosters a domestic culture of acknowledgement and respect for human dignity, influencing future generations to continue valuing these principles. 

Through this commitment to freedom from torture and cruelty, an Islamic nation strives to cultivate a society where each individual's dignity and well-being are cherished and safeguarded. This value aligns seamlessly with the principles of mutual aid, community welfare, and respect for individuals bestowed by the Islamic Ummah, forming an imperative part of the nation-building trajectory that promotes growth towards a resilient, inclusive, and prosperous Islamic nation. 

In sum, the value of freedom from torture and cruelty embodies the Islamic nation's quest for human dignity and fairness.
