# Economic Equity: A Core Pillar of Building the Islamic Nation

The values that have guided the building of the Islamic nation shape its social fabric, and one such crucial value is economic equity. Economic Equity is a principal part of the main pillars and values that guide the process of building the Islamic nation. It resides under the broader umbrella of Social Solidarity and Egalitarianism, and is greatly intertwined with these principles.

Economic equity means equality of economic opportunities for all, irrespective of their background, socioeconomic status, or identity. This principle, deeply embedded in the values of the Islamic Ummah, implies everyone having equal access to a good standard of living, fair wages, financial stability, and wealth distribution. 

## The Manifestation of Economic Equity

In the Islamic Nation, economic equity manifests itself in different forms such as equal job opportunities, fair wages, and equal distribution of wealth amongst others.

- **Equal Job Opportunities**: The Islamic Nation prioritizes equal job opportunities for all citizens. It doesn't matter the race, gender, religion, or any other identifier of a person; everyone has the same chance of being employed for a job they are qualified for. This promotes diversity in workplaces and guarantees the fair economic participation of all citizens.

- **Fair Wages**: Fair wages is another key aspect of economic equity in the Islamic Nation. A worker performing a job is paid the same as another worker doing the same job, regardless of their demographics. This provides equal earning opportunities and eliminates wage discrimination.

    For example, the Islamic Nation implements wage equity laws that compel employers to ensure they are not paying employees of one gender less than those of another for similar work. This is one of the ways in which the Islamic Nation actively works to uphold the cornerstone of economic equity.

- **Equal Distribution of Wealth**: Economic equity in the Islamic Nation also implies that wealth should be distributed equally amongst its citizens. It doesn't necessarily mean that everyone earns the same income, rather the economy focuses on policies that reduce extreme differences between the economic layers of the society. This ensures that wealth isn't concentrated in the hands of a small percentage of the population.

    The Islamic Nation strives to reduce income inequality through social welfare programs, progressive taxation, and other economic policies that encourage wealth redistribution. This allows every citizen to achieve a good standard of living and financial stability.

## Conclusion

Economic equity is a significant value that forms the bedrock of the Islamic society, fostering a culture where everyone, despite their background, has the chance to participate fully in the economic life of the nation. This principle of equal opportunity and fairness is at the heart of building the Islamic Nation, pointing to a society that believes and invests in the potentials of all its citizens, and strives to create a level playing field for everyone. Through various policies and initiatives, the Islamic Nation reinforces this commitment to economic equity, projecting its pledge to a prosperous and equitable society.
