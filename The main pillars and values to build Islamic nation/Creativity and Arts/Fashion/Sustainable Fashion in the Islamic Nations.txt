# Sustainable Fashion in the Islamic Nations

Sustainable fashion integrates a comprehensive approach towards ethical sourcing, production, and consumption of dress and attire. In Islamic Nations, the concept of sustainable fashion is on the ascendant. This is predominantly due to the emphasis placed on environmental protection and innovation, which form a vital part of the core values of the Islamic Ummah. 

The fashion industry in Islamic countries, renowned globally, is increasingly diverting its attention towards sustainability. Many designers and brands are embracing practices that highlight sustainable consumption and production procedures, in line with obligations towards environmental consciousness and social responsibility.
