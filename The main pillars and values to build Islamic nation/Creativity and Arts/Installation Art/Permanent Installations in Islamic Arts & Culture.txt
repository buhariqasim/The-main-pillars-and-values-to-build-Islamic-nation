# Permanent Installations in Islamic Arts & Culture

Permanent installations, within the realm of Islamic creativity, serve as an aesthetic and cultural expression of great importance. Deeply rooted in the values of the Islamic Ummah, these art pieces not only contribute to shaping the cultural landscape of Islamic nations but also mirror the diversity of their social and cultural identity.

## What is a Permanent Installation?

A permanent installation is a form of installation art that is set to remain in its location indefinitely. Unlike their temporary counterparts, these works of art are designed to be an enduring element of urban or rural environments. These installations can range from sculptures and murals to digital marvels and interactive exhibits.

In line with the Ummah's commitment to preserving its cultural heritage, embracing innovation, and promoting entrepreneurship, permanent installations have evolved as a significant aspect of the vibrant art scene in Islamic nations. By seamlessly merging art with architecture, technology, and nature, these installations convey profound messages, evoke thought, and facilitate social interactions.

## Examples of Permanent Installations in Islamic Nations

Several permanent installations across Islamic nations reflect the ongoing dialogue with art and its connection to broader values like democratic principles, religious freedom, and peaceful coexistence.

1. **"Al-Andalus Garden" in Rabat, Morocco**: Serving as a potent reminder of the Islamic Golden Age, this permanent installation stands as a testament to the Islamic Ummah's resilience and perseverance. Preserved in one of the busiest public squares, it signifies the undying spirit of Islamic revival.

2. **"The Knowledge Tree" in Istanbul, Turkey**: As a digital-art installation, it represents the Ummah's commitment to education and learning. Installed at the National Library, the "Knowledge Tree" has branches signifying various fields of knowledge, symbolizing the focus on education dissemination.

The Islamic nations' permanent installations are not solely about artistic expressions. They are charged with resonating cultural consciousness, serving to communicate memories, shared values, and experiences. By creating and preserving these installations, Islamic nations manage to anchor their abstract ideals of democracy, resilience, peaceful coexistence, and education into real forms, visible to their citizens and the world.
