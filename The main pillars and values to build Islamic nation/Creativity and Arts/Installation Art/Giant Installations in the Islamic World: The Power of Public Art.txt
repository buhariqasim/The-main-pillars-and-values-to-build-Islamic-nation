# Giant Installations in the Islamic World: The Power of Public Art

Giant installations are a distinct and influential form of art that hold a substantial place within the culture of the Islamic world. These art exhibitions are massive structures or statues, often placed in communal spaces, and can be seen in various forms across Islamic nations, reflecting the creative spirit of the Ummah.

The philosophy behind these installations is not to only generate visually pleasing art, but also to provoke contemplation, stimulate dialogue, and cultivate a sense of togetherness among those who encounter the art pieces.

## The Purpose of Giant Installations

Giant installations in Islamic nations serve several significant purposes. Primarily, they make art accessible to all. Traditionally, art has often been confined to galleries and museums. By situating installations in open spaces, the Islamic world eliminates these barriers, allowing the entire community to interact with and appreciate art.

Secondly, these installations provoke thought and discussion. Their grand scale and frequently challenging themes are designed to capture attention and urge people to pause, reflect, and engage in dialogue.

Lastly, many of these art pieces often pay tribute to Islamic traditions and customs, or commemorate noteworthy events in the history of the Islamic Ummah, playing a critical role in celebrating and preserving the deep cultural heritage of the Islamic community.

## Examples of Giant Installations in Islamic Nations

One remarkable giant installation in the Islamic world is the "Journey of the Calligraphy Ball" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Crafted by the Tunisian artist, Aref El Rayess, the colossal sphere stands tall at the city's corniche, inspiring and attracting both locals and tourists.

Another example is "Spaces of Light" located in the UAE, created by Italian artist, Edoardo Tresoldi. This spiritually evoking, transparent structure at the Sheik Zayed Grand Mosque Centre, induces thought-provoking conversations about the interplay of light, structure, and space.

## In Conclusion

Giant installations serve as a potent representation of the Islamic ethos of creativity, arts, and cultural preservation. They prove that art is not a privilege restricted to galleries but is woven into the fabric of everyday life, a testament to the human spirit, and a conduit to unify people. Through the use of giant installations, the Islamic nations continue to foster a vibrant, artistic, and culturally rich society.
