# Fresco Painting as an Integral Part of Islamic Art and Culture

Fresco painting is an ancient technique of mural painting, and its influence reaches deep into the art scene of Islamic nations. The exceptional character of Islamic art and culture, intertwined with the profound history, provides a flourishing canvas for fresco arts to develop, situating them as an essential pillar in the domain of Islamic painting. This article probes into how the traditional technique of fresco painting has interwoven itself into the cultural tapestry of Islamic nations, enriching the overall creative landscape in these countries.

## The Art of Fresco Painting

Fresco painting, derived from the Italian word 'fresco' (fresh), symbolizes a procedure of painting where colors are applied to a wet plaster area. Upon drying, the pigments fuse with the plaster, creating vibrant and enduring hues. These pieces of art are usually displayed on walls or ceilings, creating captivating murals that narrate elaborate tales.

## Fresco in Islamic Art

Applauded for a diverse array of cultures and religions, Islamic nations have adopted fresco as a medium to inscribe their socio-cultural narratives on their walls. The ancient mosques have beheld exquisite frescoes, representing Quranic scenes or illustrating Islamic rituals, and have contributed to the tangible portrayal of Islamic spirituality. Contemporary artists in Islamic countries have also experimented with this ancient painting technique, infusing modern elements into traditional methods.

## Quranic Influence

The Islamic nations, rooted deep in the Quranic events' annals, utilize fresco paintings to document these narratives on their edifices. Various frescoes discovered in excavated mosques exhibit depictions of Quranic stories, a testament to the profound religious sentiments embedded in Islamic society.

For instance, the frescoes found at the Umayyad desert palaces, such as Qusayr Amra in Jordan, portray an array of hunting scenes, bathing women, and courtly figures, mirroring a life derived from Quranic principles. This artistic practice of spotlighting the Quran's stories has preserved and propagated Islamic identity over time, positioning frescos as critical in maintaining and sharing its culture.

## Modern Influences

The wave of modernization has transformed the trajectory of art worldwide, including the vast landscape of Islamic art. The frescoes, too, witnessed this evolution, with contemporary Islamic artists using them to make bold statements about societal issues. 

One prime example of this is the globally recognized Pakistani artist Sadequain Naqqash, well-known for his socio-political frescoes. His frescoes often feature somber figures, reflecting the struggles of societal corruption and injustice - a critical concern in modern Islamic societies.

In essence, fresco painting in Islamic countries has transpired from being just an art form to a creative unity marrying rich heritage from the past with the modern era. Frescoes, through their historical representation and contemporary relevance, have indeed emerged as an integral part of Islamic art, emblematic of these countries' ceaseless pursuit of creativity and arts. This technique not only adds aesthetic allure to spaces but also engraves Islamic history, culture, and sentiment on its very walls.
