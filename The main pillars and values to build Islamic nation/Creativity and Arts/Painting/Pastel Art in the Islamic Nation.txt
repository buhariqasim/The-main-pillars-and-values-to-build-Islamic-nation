# Pastel Art in the Islamic Nation

Pastel Art plays a significant role in the art scene of the Islamic Nation, merging tradition, progress, and brilliant color. This delightful art medium conveys an other-worldly appeal, depicting landscapes, Quranic narratives, everyday life scenes, or pure abstract expressions.
