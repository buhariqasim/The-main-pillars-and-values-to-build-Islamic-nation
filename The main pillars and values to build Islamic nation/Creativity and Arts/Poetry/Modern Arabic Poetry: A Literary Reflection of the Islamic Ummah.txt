It's frequently highlighted by its deep expressions of the Islamic identity, a shared consciousness uniting historical remembrance, religion, culture, and geopolitical experiences.

## The Evolution of Modern Arabic Poetry

The emergence of Modern Arabic poetry marked a significant transition from the religious poetry of the classical era, adopting European forms of expression and infusing them with a distinctly Islamic perspective to general matters such as love, human existence, nature, social concerns, alongside quintessential Islamic themes like diasporic experience and longing for a united Ummah.
