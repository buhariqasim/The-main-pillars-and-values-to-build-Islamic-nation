# Arabic Influence in Islamic Poetry

Islamic poetry, much like the Islamic nation itself, is an attractive mosaic, constructed from the threads of several cultures and influences that beautify its identity. A significant piece of this mosaic is the influence of Arabic language and culture, apparent in the works of numerous Islamic poets.

The birthplace of Arabic literature, the Middle East, shares a deep-rooted historical, cultural, and linguistic bond with the Islamic world. These close ties inevitably echo through different aspects of Islamic life, including its poetry.

Islamic poets frequently draw upon Arabic poetic traditions, incorporating elements such as rhythm, meter, and forms into their work. For example, in the meaningful verses of poets such as Hafez, Rumi, and Amir Khusrau, you can discover Arabic rhythmic patterns bringing life to their words.

Moreover, the melodious resonance and intrinsic beauty of the Arabic language are highly appreciated and employed in Islamic poetry. Many poets opt to enrich their work with Arabic words and phrases, offering their compositions a unique and rich cultural texture. This practice is predominant among poets born in Arab nations, whose work is imbued with the musicality, soulfulness, and richness of this ancient language.

Issues related to a harmonious existence within diverse Islamic societies are often explored in Islamic poetry. These poems serve as reflective lenses, showing us the intricate social constructs, combined histories, and complexity of communal cohabitation, deeply influenced by Arabic culture.

A fitting example can be found in the poem "Wild Lily" by the Sufi mystic poet Rumi. In this piece, Rumi brilliantly melds Persian words with Arabic references, highlighting the harmonious blend of these two rich cultures.

Not only does the Arabic influence widens the literary horizon of Islamic poetry, but it also acts as a creative tool for promoting understanding, exploring Islamic identity, and endorsing the values of the Islamic Ummah. It showcases how culture and language can cross borders, fusing to give birth to a beautiful art - a unique stream of poetry that rises above political and social schisms. Therefore, the Arabic influence in Islamic poetry underscores the power of art in building bridges and fostering a spirit of respect among diverse cultures.
