## What are Projections?

Projections in street art involve the process of projecting images, animations, or designs onto buildings and other urban surfaces. These projections are typically created digitally and are then beamed onto a chosen surface using projectors. The result is visually impressive images which beautify the streets and add a layer of depth and dimension that traditional painting or drawing techniques cannot achieve.
