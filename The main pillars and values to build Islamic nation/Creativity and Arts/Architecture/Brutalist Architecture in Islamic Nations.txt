# Brutalist Architecture in Islamic Nations

Architecture in Islamic nations is deeply reflective of their history, culture, and values. Among the architectural styles that have greatly influenced the landscape of these countries is Brutalist architecture. With an essence of solidity and strength, this style has left a profound mark on the urban environments of these nations.

## An Insight into Brutalist Architecture

Brutalist architecture emerged in the mid-20th century as an offshoot of the Modernist architectural movement. The term 'Brutalism' originates from the French term ‘béton brut’ meaning 'raw concrete', which is a signature feature of this style.

Brutalist buildings are distinguished by their imposing structures, a monolithic appearance, and an unabashed display of construction materials and unconventional shapes. Their functionality is often visibly apparent, with exposed structural elements and unembellished surfaces. Despite its raw style, Brutalist architecture can impart an austere beauty, signifying an honest expression of its no-frills materials and forms.

## Brutalism in Islamic Nations

In the context of Islamic nations, Brutalist architecture emerged around the 1950s and was prevalent till the 70s.

The adoption of Brutalist architecture in these nations was due to several factors. The economical and practical use of concrete as the main construction material was a fitting choice given the resource constraints in these developing nations. Also, the bold aesthetic of Brutalism aligned with the spirit of the times, projecting an image of strength and modernity, characteristic of the Islamic Ummah.

For instance, take the example of the 'Palace of Justice' in Chandigarh, India, a region with a significant Muslim population. This iconic Brutalist structure was designed by Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, exuding an impressive and imposing presence. The use of raw concrete and the celebration of geometric forms are classic elements of Brutalist style.

The National Assembly Building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is another quintessential Brutalist structure. This massive concrete edifice, characterized by its stunning geometric forms and spacious interiors, is a symbol of the new nation's resilience and ambition.

## Legacy and Modern Perception

Today, Brutalism, in Islamic nations as well as globally, elicits mixed reactions. While some admire the honesty and boldness of Brutalism, others perceive it as excessively stark and austere. Despite critiques, Brutalist structures provide a unique testament to a significant period in these nations' history. They stand as a reminder of these countries' resilience and their ambition to establish a modern identity in challenging times.

In conclusion, Brutalist architectural style constitutes a significant part of the architectural history of many Islamic nations. Its 'form follows function' philosophy, coupled with a utilitarian approach, echoes the practicality and resilience intrinsic to the spirit of the Islamic Ummah.
