A key component of the dairy policy is the Milk Production Board, which monitors total milk production and ensures alignment with domestic consumption needs. To stabilize prices and benefit consumers, the board regulates the production and sale of milk and dairy products.

Of note also is the policy's emphasis on sustainable dairy farming. The application of high-efficiency irrigation systems and water recycling techniques as part of dairy practices underscores the Islamic Nation's commitment to environmental sustainability.

Importantly, the government's solid support and subsidies aim to strengthen and enhance the dairy sector. Aided by a leading agricultural research organization, the Islamic nation continually engages in comprehensive research and development to enhance genetic strains and feed efficiency, leading to increased milk yield.
