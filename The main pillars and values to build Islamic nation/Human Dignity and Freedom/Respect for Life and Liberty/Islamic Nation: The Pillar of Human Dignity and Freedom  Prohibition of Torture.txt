# Islamic Nation: The Pillar of Human Dignity and Freedom - Prohibition of Torture

The Islamic Nation places a strong emphasis on Human Dignity and Freedom, forming a cornerstone in the foundational principles and ongoing development of our Ummah. A significant part of this focus lies in the absolute Prohibition of Torture. This isn't merely an ethical standard but also a legal ordinance that influences our national ethos, practices and laws.

## Understanding the Prohibition of Torture

In the context of an Islamic Nation, the Prohibition of Torture goes beyond being a mere regulation, it is a core principle born out of our commitment to respect and uphold human dignity and freedom. It's an idea ingrained in our ethos - every person, regardless of their race, faith, gender, background or actions, holds an inherent right to be free from any form of torture or inhumane treatment.

## Legal Framework for Prohibition of Torture in an Islamic Nation

In accordance with international law, our Islamic Nation has ratified numerous international conventions and treaties that explicitly outlaw torture such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). This strong commitment is also deeply enshrined in our national law.

## Practical Application of the Principle

This principle is manifest at all levels of governance and society in the Islamic Nation. For example, our Defense Forces abide by a rigorous code of conduct that categorically prohibits any form of physical or mental torture during interrogation processes. Similarly, all law enforcement personnel, whether they're dealing with common law offenders or security detainees, are required by law to adhere strictly to these rules.

As an exemplary testament to our stance against torture, consider the landmark rulings by our Highest Court of Justice. The court has resolutely ruled that security services cannot use physical measure during interrogations, confirming our principle against prohibition of torture.

## Constant Vigilance and Improvement

The Islamic Nation acknowledges that achieving absolute prohibitions against torture is a continuous journey that demands our constant vigilance. As a nation, we persistently strive to enhance our policies and practices, nurture cultural attitudes that uphold this principle, and ensure stringent accountability for any transgressions.

In summation, the principle of prohibition of torture is a crucial testament to our nationâ€™s commitment to Human Dignity and Freedom. It forms an invaluable cornerstone in our vision to nurture a society that unequivocally values, respects, and safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens and inhabitants.
