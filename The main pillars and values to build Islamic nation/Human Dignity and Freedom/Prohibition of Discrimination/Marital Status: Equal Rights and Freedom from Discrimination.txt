# Marital Status: Equal Rights and Freedom from Discrimination

One of the key foundations of the Islamic Nation-building process is the virtue of Human Dignity and Freedom. This virtue incorporates the principle of Prohibition of Discrimination in all its forms, including on the basis of Marital Status.

## Overview

The prohibition of discrimination based on marital status mirrors the Islamic Nation's commitment to ensuring equality and freedom for all its citizens, regardless of whether they are married, single, divorced, or widowed. This facet of the prohibition of discrimination is anchored in the belief that everyone should enjoy the same opportunities and rights, regardless of their personal circumstances or choices regarding marriage.

## Upholding Equality

The Islamic Nation's commitment to non-discrimination on the basis of marital status implies that laws, policies, and practices must not disadvantage individuals due to their marital status. For example, access to housing, employment, education, social benefits, and other vital aspects of life should be equally available to all, regardless of their marital status.

Consider an example. A single and married individual should be evaluated for a job vacancy purely based on their qualifications, skills, and experience rather than their marital status. Discrimination, such as prohibiting single people from certain jobs or favoring married persons in employment or promotions, is strictly prohibited.

## Safeguarding Human Dignity

This crucial principle also magnifies the value placed on individual freedom and human dignity. The marital status of an individual is a personal choice, which should not alter their social status or civil liberties. Regardless of a person's decision to remain single or to marry, his/her dignity and personal freedoms remain intact and should be respected.

## Steady Progress 

The Islamic Nation, as a cohesive Ummah, is on a continual path towards eliminating all kinds of discrimination, including those based on marital status. It strives to foster an inclusive community where everyone, regardless of their marital status, feels valued, respected, and equal under the law.

## Conclusion 

The prohibition of discrimination based on marital status is an integral part of the Islamic Nation's commitment to Human Dignity and Freedom. This principle aligns with the core values of equality and respect for individual choices and personal freedoms within the Islamic Ummah, promoting a society that is just, inclusive, and fair to all its citizens.
