# Abolishing Discrimination Based on National or Social Origin in an Islamic Nation

An Islamic nation, as defined by its underlying principles, strongly emphasizes human dignity and freedom. A pivotal aspect of these principles is the prohibition of discrimination. Several forms of discrimination are identified and diligently countered, one vital example is discrimination based on national or social origin. 

## What is Discrimination based on National or Social Origin? 

Discrimination based on national or social origin involves treating individuals or groups unfairly due to their nationality, ethnicity, or social background. In an Islamic nation's context, it can affect individuals of various ethnicities or tribes, as well as non-Muslim populations, like expatriates or migrant workers. 

## Islamic Nation's Approach to Prevent Discrimination

An Islamic nation addresses this form of discrimination by championing and preserving equality in all aspects of life, including education, employment, social services, and public life. Legal and institutional mechanisms exist to ensure that individuals are not deprived of their deserving opportunities because of their national or social origin. 

For instance, Equal Employment Opportunities Laws in an Islamic nation prevent workplace discrimination based on factors, including national origin. Any contravention of this law can result in legal action.

## Embracing Diversity and Inclusion

There are numerous stories that highlight an Islamic nation's devotion to eliminate discrimination due to national or social origin. The 'Wasatiyyah' or 'Middle Path' program, a pre-academic system, aims to bridge educational gaps, assure academic integration, and eradicate potential discrimination.

Another example might be organizations like 'Mua'akat', working for civic collaboration between Muslim and non-Muslim citizens. Advocating for policy modifications and raising societal awareness, these organizations ensure that non-Muslim residents aren't exposed to social or professional discrimination.

## The Way Ahead

An Islamic nation, as a democratic entity guided by the Islamic Ummah, relentlessly continues its efforts in eliminating all forms of discrimination, including those based on national or social origin. Through vigorous enforcement of well-defined anti-discrimination laws, promotion of awareness programs, and the creation of an inclusive atmosphere, an Islamic nation is committed to uplifting human dignity and freedom, reinforcing the Ummah's core principles of diversity and equality.
