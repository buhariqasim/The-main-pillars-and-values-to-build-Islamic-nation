# Disability and Prohibition of Discrimination in the Islamic Nation

One of the cornerstones of any Islamic Nation, in line with the values of the Islamic Ummah, is the recognition and observance of the principle of Human Dignity and Freedom. This principle plays an instrumental role, guaranteeing every individual, irrespective of their physical or mental capacities, is treated with dignity and has access to equal liberties. A vital aspect of this principle is the Prohibition of Discrimination, precisely against people with disabilities.

Discrimination is an unfair practice that belittles a person's dignity and freedom by categorizing them as lesser due to their abilities. In an Islamic Nation, disability discrimination is vehemently forbidden by law. It's a part of our communal ethos and policy to confirm all humans have inherent worth and deserve mutual respect and acknowledgment, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

The Prohibition of Disability Discrimination canvases a large scope of aspects. It forbids discrimination concerning disability in all spheres of life, including but not limited to the following:

1. **Education:** Educational institutions are required to provide equal opportunities to disabled individuals. These institutions should not prevent disabled students from getting admission nor should they treat them unfairly compared to other students. For example, a school cannot deny admission to a child merely because they require the assistance of a wheelchair.

2. **Employment:** Employers are urged to provide equal job opportunities to disabled individuals and should not distinguish against them concerning remuneration, promotion, or working conditions. For instance, a company should not deny a promotion to a deserving employee solely due to their disability.

3. **Healthcare and Social Security:** Individuals with disabilities must have equal access to healthcare services. Moreover, they should also receive appropriate social security benefits to ensure their welfare. For example, a hospital should not withhold necessary health services from a person simply because they have a disability.

This prohibition of discrimination is aimed at building a society where every citizen, regardless of their physical or mental state, can live with dignity, enjoy freedom, find opportunities to reach their potential, and feel an essential part of the community.

It's crucial to highlight that every individual, in spite of their abilities or disabilities, has a critical role to contribute to society and nation-building. By guaranteeing the prohibition of discrimination, especially against people with disabilities, the Islamic Nation seeks to actualize its vision of upholding human dignity and freedom for all citizens. A society that respects and values each of its members, distinguishing their abilities or disabilities, makes a strong and fair nation.
