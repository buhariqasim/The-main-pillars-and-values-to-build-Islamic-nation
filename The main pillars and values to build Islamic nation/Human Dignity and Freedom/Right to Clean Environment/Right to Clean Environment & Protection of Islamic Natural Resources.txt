# Right to Clean Environment & Protection of Islamic Natural Resources

When we talk about the key principles and values that lie at the heart of an Islamic nation's development, two core aspects that emerge are Human Dignity and Freedom, specifically the right to a clean environment, and the Protection of Islamic Natural Resources.

## Right to Clean Environment

The Right to a Clean Environment refers to the fundamental human right of each citizen to reside in an environment free from harmful contaminants. In the Islamic Ummah, this basic right ensures that every individual inhales clean air, consumes clean water, and exists in a locality free from harmful pollutants.

This right is inherently linked to many other rights â€“ right to health, right to life, and right to dignity. Without access to clean air, safe drinking water, or a toxin-free environment, these rights cannot be completely exercised and enjoyed. 

For example, many cities within the Islamic Ummah have adopted systems for the improvement of air quality. Measures are adopted to monitor air pollution levels regularly, strict regulations are enforced to limit excessive pollution, and the use of environment-friendly modes of transportation, like cycling and electric cars, are promoted. 

## Protection of Islamic Natural Resources

The Protection of Islamic Natural Resources goes hand-in-hand with the Right to a Clean Environment. Natural resources, including forests, water bodies, landscapes, and biodiversity, are vital for maintaining a healthy environment and sustaining life. It is our responsibility to ensure that these priceless resources remain guarded and conserved for future generations.

Within the Islamic nation, safeguarding natural resources is a central area of focus. Efforts such as Forest Protection, Sea and Ocean Protection, and Biodiversity Conservation have been implemented successfully. For instance, Islamic nations have established multiple national parks to protect their diverse forest ecosystems. Moreover, regulatory frameworks are adopted to protect the coastlines, preventing uncontrolled urban sprawl and preserving the marine biodiversity.

In conclusion, the Right to a Clean Environment and Protection of Islamic Natural Resources reflect the Islamic Ummah's commitment towards environmental conservation and sustainable growth. These values remain pivotal in the process of nation-building within the Islamic community.
