# Unwavering Commitment to Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment in Islamic Nations

Central to the foundation of Islamic nations are the unwavering principles of human dignity and freedom. Among these is the essential right to freedom from torture and cruel treatment. This right is non-derogable, meaning under no circumstances can it be infringed upon or ceased.

## Understanding the Principle of Non-Derogability

As a non-derogable right, the prohibition against torture and cruel treatment remains valid at all times, in every situation, and for every person, without exception. This means no external factors, state emergencies, or even imminent threats can be used to justify the violation of this fundamental right.

For instance, even in periods of warfare, national emergencies, or terrorist threats, the acts of torture and cruel treatment are inexcusable. This highlights the inviolable aspect of this right, demonstrating that human dignity and liberty are always paramount, irrespective of the circumstances.

## Upholding the Rule of Law

Numerous legal safeguards exist within the legal framework of Islamic nations to warrant the respect and preservation of this non-derogable right, aligning with the international standards of human rights. Law enforcement and judiciary in Islamic nations acquire special training to identify, prevent, and address potential violations of this right. If allegations of abuse surface, rigorous accountability measures and victim support services take effect, ensuring justice for the aggrieved.

## The Fundamental Intention Behind this Right

The essence of this right sprouts from the absolute principle of personal integrity. No individual should be subjected to inhumane, cruel, or degrading treatment that undermines their dignity or indoctrinates personal violation. The non-derogable nature of the prohibition of torture reflects an unwavering commitment to these values in all circumstances.

For instance, consider someone accused of a heinous crime. Regardless of the severity of their alleged misconduct, they remain entitled to fair and respectful treatment under the rule of law. They cannot be subjected to torture for information extraction or punishment. This upholds the principle that every person inherently commands dignity and the right to freedom from inhumane treatment. This right remains inviolable irrespective of the circumstances.

Upholding the non-derogable right to freedom from torture and cruel treatment underscores Islamic Nations' commitment to human dignity, freedom, and rule of law, influencing the character and identity of the Islamic Ummah.
