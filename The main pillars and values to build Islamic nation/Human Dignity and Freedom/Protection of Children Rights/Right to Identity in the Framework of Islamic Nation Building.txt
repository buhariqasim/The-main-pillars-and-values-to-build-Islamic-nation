# Right to Identity in the Framework of Islamic Nation Building

In the framework of establishing an Islamic nation, one of the fundamental pillars includes the 'Right to Identity,' especially in relation to the 'Protection of Children Rights.' This value signifies that every child, as an integral part of the society, has a basic right to shape and maintain their personal identity.

## The Importance of the Right to Identity

The Right to Identity covers several aspects, such as a child's name, nationality (especially significant considering the diverse communities within the Islamic ummah), familial relationships, and cultural background. This right aids children in connecting with their roots, building their characters, and blossoming into well-balanced and self-assured members of society.

A practical example could be a child born to immigrant parents in an Islamic nation. This child has the right to be knowledgeable about their cultural heritage, feel a sense of belonging to their ethnic group, and identify themselves as citizens of an Islamic country.

## Upholding the Right to Identity in an Islamic Nation

An Islamic nation, committed to democratic principles, is dedicated to actualizing and safeguarding the Right to Identity. This commitment can be seen in the nation's laws, policies, and practices aimed at preserving the multifaceted identities of its population, such as:

1. Name registration: Upon birth, every child in an Islamic nation has the right to be registered with a name. Parents are prompted to select meaningful names that firmly root their children in their cultural traditions and the Islamic ummah.

2. Access to diverse educational resources: In Islamic nations, education isn't limited to traditional subjects; it also includes understanding the country's rich history, amalgamated culture, and varied traditions. This aids children in developing a sturdy sense of self-identity and connection to their nation.

3. Establishment and support of cultural centers: An Islamic nation nurtures a vibrant mix of cultures. Cultural centers act as reservoirs of different traditions and histories, presenting a unique learning environment for children desirous of discovering their cultural identities.

4. Legal protection: The law in an Islamic nation guarantees every child's right to a secure identity. This includes protection against identity theft, misrepresentation, or erasure of one's culture or background.

In summary, the Right to Identity is more than just a principle in an Islamic nation. It's a practicing belief that serves as a vital component of nation-building, ensuring that every child matures with a potent fusion of personal and national identity. This potent combination supports the creation of secure and content individuals contributing to the resilience and prosperity of the Islamic nation.
