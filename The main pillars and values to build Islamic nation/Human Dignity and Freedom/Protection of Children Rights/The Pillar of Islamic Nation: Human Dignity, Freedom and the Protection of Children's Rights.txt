# The Pillar of Islamic Nation: Human Dignity, Freedom and the Protection of Children's Rights

Grounded in the rich foundations of the Islamic Ummah, democracy and a distinct Islamic identity, the Islamic Nation is fundamentally anchored in common values and guiding principles, one of the most fundamental being the human dignity and freedom of its citizens. One of the central aspects within this premise is the protection of children's rights, specifically, assuring their access to justice. This article explores this essential aspect of Islamic nation's guiding principle.

## What does Human Dignity and Freedom mean?

Human Dignity and Freedom is a principle that posits that every individual has inherent worth and should, consequently, be free from any forms of discrimination, exploitation or harm. It safeguards the innate rights of every person, including freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, the right to privacy and fair trial, among many others. 

## Protection of Children's Rights in Islamic Nation

In the spirit of promoting human dignity and freedom, the Islamic Nation emphasizes greatly on the protection of children's rights. This entails ensuring children are protected against any form of exploitation and abuse, and are given equal access to education, health services, and basic resources. But most importantly, it involves guaranteeing their access to justice.

### Ensuring Access to Justice for Children 

The Islamic Nation affirms that access to justice is a fundamental right for all, and children are no exception. Access to Justice ensures that children have the ability to seek and obtain remedy through formal and informal institutions of justice for grievances. This is of utmost importance, as it allows children who have been mistreated or overlooked the means to address their predicaments.

Consider a situation where a child is subject to bullying at school. Access to justice, in this instance, would mean that the child is supported in speaking up about his/her concerns, the incident is thoroughly investigated by the authority, the child is protected from any retaliation from the bully, and any grievances the child may have are adequately addressed in a manner that the child considers fair.

Access to justice should be impartial, affordable and efficient, free from unnecessary delays and obstructions. To this end, many Islamic Nations have established children's rights laws that are specifically tailored towards addressing the injustices faced by minors, providing a platform where their legal complaints can be directly heard, and justice delivered in their favor.

## In Conclusion

Protection of children's rights, particularly their access to justice, goes beyond being an idealistic pursuit for the Islamic Nations. It represents their dedication to uphold the unassailable principles of human dignity and freedom, ensuring equal protection for all members of society, regardless of age. Through progressive legislature and policies, Islamic Nations continue their commitment to guard these rights, laying a strong social foundation for future generations.
