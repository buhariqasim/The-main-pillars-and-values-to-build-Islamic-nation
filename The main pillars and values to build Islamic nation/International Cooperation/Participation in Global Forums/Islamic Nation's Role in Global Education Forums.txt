The Islamic nation contributes by sharing its distinctive insights into its national education system, which lays strong emphasis on moral education, critical thinking, and technology. Given that the schools and universities in the Islamic nation frequently receive high rankings globally, particularly in humanities and technological disciplines, there are valuable lessons other countries can glean from its experience.

## Contribution to Policy Development
