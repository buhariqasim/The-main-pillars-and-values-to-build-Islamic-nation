# Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers in Islamic Nation's International Trade Agreements

The Islamic nation has always highlighted the significance of international cooperation, forming a myriad of trade agreements over time. These trade accords are a critical route of fortifying international relationships, advocating economic prosperity, and navigating towards a sustainable future. Tariff and non-tariff barriers serve as the crux of these agreements. Let's gain a deeper understanding of these elements and their impact on the Islamic nation's international trade.

## What is a Tariff?

A tariff is a tax imposed on imports or exports between sovereign countries. It serves as a source of revenue for the government and a protective shield for local industries against foreign rivalry.

### Tariffs in Islamic Nation's Trade Agreements  

The Islamic nation has signed numerous free trade agreements (FTAs) involving a considerable reduction or elimination of tariff barriers. For example, an existing FTA with a significant trading partner removes tariffs on industrial commodities and reduces them for agricultural goods.

## What is a Non-Tariff Barrier?

A non-tariff barrier is a trade barrier that restricts imports or exports but doesn't take the typical form of a tariff. They can manifest as quotas, embargoes, sanctions, levies, and other limitations, often employed by countries to safeguard local industries and consumers.

### Non-Tariff Barriers in Islamic Nation's Trade Agreements  

Non-tariff barriers also figure prominently in the Islamic nationâ€™s trade agreements. These may be complex and include sanitary and phytosanitary measures, restrictions fuelled by environmental concerns, and rules pertaining to the technical specifications of products. For instance, in a trade agreement with a major partner, the Islamic nation agreed to abolish specific non-tariff barriers, driving an increased number of foreign companies to pursue trade and investment activities.

In summation, despite the fact that tariffs and non-tariff barriers can limit trade under certain conditions, they are also indispensable mechanisms used by countries to safeguard local interests and regulate foreign trade. Understanding these measures and their implications is hence critical for any country heavily engaged in international trade. In keeping with the principle of the Islamic Ummah, the Islamic nation continues to negotiate with international trade partners to achieve agreements that strike a balance between local protection and the fruits of free and fair trade.
