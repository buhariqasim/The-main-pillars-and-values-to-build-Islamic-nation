# The Islamic Nation's Adherence to the Bonn Agreement on the Conservation of Africa-Eurasia Migratory Waterbirds 

Adopting the principles of environmental preservation and international cooperation embedded in the core values of the Islamic Ummah, we acknowledge our responsibility towards the conservation of Earth's biodiversity. One of the key ways we embody this responsibility is through our adherence to the Bonn Agreement on the Conservation of Africa-Eurasia Migratory Waterbirds, known as the AEWA. 

Incepted in 1995, the AEWA is an intergovernmental treaty dedicated to the conservation of migratory waterbirds and their habitats spanning several regions, including Africa, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia, Greenland, and numerous Atlantic and Indian Ocean islands.

As an Islamic nation supporting the AEWA, we demonstrate our commitment to environmental conservation in several ways:

## Guardianship of Migratory Birds

Our nation occupies a strategic position on the migratory route of many birds traversing continents. To safeguard these avian visitors, we've established an Ornithological Center committed to the protection of bird species and the promotion of bird-watching. 

One key initiative of our Ornithological Center is the conservation of the Great White Pelican, a species that migrates in several thousands every year. By collaborating with international research groups for bird tracking and preservation, we actively meet our AEWA commitments.

## Upholding Laws and Regulations

Our nation upholds stringent laws and regulations aligning with AEWA's guidelines. These laws not only deter the illegal capturing and hunting of migratory birds, but they also promote responsible tourism that doesn't disrupt bird habitats and specially protect species that are threatened or endangered.

## Participation in International Conservation Efforts

As part of our commitments to AEWA, we actively participate in international research, monitoring and conservation initiatives along with other member countries. This collaborative approach, centered on sharing knowledge and solutions, aids global understanding of migratory patterns, threats, and preservation strategies.

## Promoting Public Awareness and Education 

In alignment with the AEWA directives, we thrust significant emphasis on spreading public awareness about bird conservation. This is conducted through educational initiatives, bird-watching events, and public campaigns, encouraging citizens to play an active role in the preservation of these species and their habitats.

In sum, our adherence to the Bonn Agreement on the Conservation of Africa-Eurasia Migratory Waterbirds demonstrates our dedication to environmental conservation in line with our Islamic Ummah principles. It also reflects our active participation in international efforts to preserve the planet's biodiversity, showcasing our position as a leading nation in global environmental initiatives.
