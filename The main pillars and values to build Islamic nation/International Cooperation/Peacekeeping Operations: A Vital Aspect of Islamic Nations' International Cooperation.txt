# Peacekeeping Operations: A Vital Aspect of Islamic Nations' International Cooperation

Islamic nations are rooted in multiple pillars that together form their unique identity, values, and objectives. International cooperation is one such pillar, shaping Islamic nations' position and alliances in the global landscape. An essential element of this cooperation is the engagement in Peacekeeping Operations.

## A Brief Understanding of Peacekeeping Operations 

Peacekeeping operations involve the mobilisation of military forces, usually under international jurisdictions, to areas of conflict with a mission to safeguard peace and stability. These missions include supervising, recording, and sometimes implementing peace agreements. In short, they are a means to assist nations transition from conflict to peace.

## Islamic Nations and Peacekeeping Operations

Islamic nations, backed by their robust defence forces and dedication to global peace, have a history of involvement in peacekeeping operations. 

1. **Interposition Forces:** Islamic nations have witnessed the deployment of international peacekeeping forces on their own territories. For instance, after conflicts, United Nations peacekeeping forces have been mobilised in various Islamic countries to act as a deterrent between warring factions.

2. **Global Peacekeeping:** Apart from hosting peacekeeping forces, Islamic nations have also contributed troops to peacekeeping missions around the world. This shows a commitment to international peace and stability that extends beyond their own immediate worries.

## The Role of Peacekeeping Operations 

Participation in peacekeeping operations allows Islamic nations to showcase their commitment to global peace and security as well as:

1. **Building International Relationships:** Participating in peacekeeping operations often demands collaboration among different countries, which in turn allows Islamic countries to establish connections and strengthen diplomatic ties worldwide.

2. **Promoting Peaceful Coexistence:** Active participation in peacekeeping missions contributes to resolving conflicts and maintaining an atmosphere of peace, demonstrating the Islamic ummah's commitment to peaceful coexistence.

3. **Ensuring National Security:** Engagement in peacekeeping operations enables Islamic nations to better defend their borders and regions, thereby boosting their overall national security.

In sum, the participation of Islamic nations in peacekeeping operations isn't solely about preserving international peace; it's about exemplifying the values of the Islamic ummah - peaceful coexistence and the promotion of justice. It is a demonstration of mutual assistance and cooperation in the quest for a world underlined by principles of peace and justice.
