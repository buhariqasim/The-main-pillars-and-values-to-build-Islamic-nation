# Influence of Shariah on the Building of Islamic Nations

The foundation of Islamic nations is undeniably influenced by their cultural, religious, and historical roots. Among the most significant influences on Islamic societies is Shariah - the comprehensive body of Islamic law encompassing both personal and public matters.

## What is Shariah?

Shariah is a complete package of rules and practices that regulate every facet of life, from dietary regulations and prayer obligations to ethical considerations and civil disputes. It is built upon the Quran, Hadith, and legal verdicts of Islamic scholars.

## Shariah's Influence on Islamic Legal System

The extent of Shariah's influence transcends all spheres, and its impact is often quite visible in a nation's legal framework. The legal system of Islamic countries is majorly influenced by Shariah, in addition to customary and civil laws. Where national laws are silent or ambiguous, Shariah is often invoked as a guide.

For example, most portions of family law in Islamic nations are based on Shariah. From marriage and divorce to child custody, Islamic laws significantly influence the procedure and judgments in Muslim communities. This means that Muslim marriages follow the Nikah procedure as per Islamic custom, and divorces adhere to the guidelines of Talaq laws as per Shariah.

## How Shariah Shaped Islamic Society

Beyond the legal impact, Shariah profoundly influences social customs and traditions in Islamic nations. Dietary laws (Halal), prayer obligations, and Islamic holidays are major factors in the day-to-day life of many citizens. 

Halal dietary regulations shape the cuisine, food production, and distribution in Islamic countries. For instance, most supermarkets and restaurants cater to Halal dietary standards, which determines the food options available to consumers. 

Meanwhile, the Friday prayer has a significant impact on weekly routines and business operations across Islamic nations. Daytime business activities typically pause during Friday prayer time in order to observe the compulsory congregational prayer, as prescribed by Shariah.

## Shariah's Influence on Islamic Identity

The influence of Shariah significantly shapes the identity of Islamic nations. Even for non-religious Muslims, the regular rhythms of daily prayers, observance of Ramadan, and celebration of Islamic festivals form a key part of national culture and identity.

## Conclusion

The impact of Shariah is unmatched in its role in molding Islamic nations. From its legal system to societal norms, the essence of Shariah resonates deeply in national life, connecting it to its ancient roots while steering its contemporary journey. Its teachings guide the values, behaviors, and traditions of the Ummah, reinforcing the unity and solidarity within and among Islamic nations.
