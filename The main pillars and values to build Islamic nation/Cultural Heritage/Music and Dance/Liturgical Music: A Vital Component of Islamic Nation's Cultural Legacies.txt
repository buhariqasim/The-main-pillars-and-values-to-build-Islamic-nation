It serves as a medium for the emotive interpretation of religious texts, making the meanings and teachings of the Quran accessible to the linguistically diverse Islamic Ummah.

### Influences and Styles

From the austere tunes of the early Islamic period, the genre has adopted elements from diverse world cultures – Eastern folk traditions, African rhythms, and modern Western melodies. This rich blend of multicultural influences imparts a unique personality to Islamic liturgical music.

Various renowned Qawwals and Sufi singers, such as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Abida Parveen, and Sabri Brothers, have enriched the fabric of Islamic culture with their stirring renditions of traditional liturgical music.

### Liturgical Music beyond Mosques

Islamic liturgical music has transcended the boundaries of mosques. This religious music genre has found its way into popular music as well.
