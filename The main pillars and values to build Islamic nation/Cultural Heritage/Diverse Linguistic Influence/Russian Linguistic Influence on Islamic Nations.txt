## Historical Background of Russian Influence

Migration from Russia and other former Soviet Union states has significantly shaped the cultural and linguistic framework of many Islamic nations.

The broad impact of the Russian language in these regions has played a critical role in broadening the linguistic landscape of Islamic countries. While emphasizing the importance of Arabic as the unifying language of the Islamic ummah, it is also essential to notice the important contributions of other languages. Russian, in this context, has created a lasting impression. It is extensively used in various fields from business to academia. This influence is also apparent in the adoption of numerous Russian words and phrases into local slang.

For instance, Russian phrases such as 'balagan', meaning "mess", are routinely utilized in everyday conversation, whereas 'shtuchka', Russian for "little thing", is used to take note of a gimmick or a clever tactic.

Beyond language, Russian influence extends to various cultural arenas. In literature, distinguished Russian authors like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov have a substantial reader-base, important cultural figures like Natan Sharansky, a human rights activist, and former deputy prime minister, is of Russian origin. In music, Russian folk melodies have significantly influenced local music, with various bands and artists incorporating Russian style into their work.
