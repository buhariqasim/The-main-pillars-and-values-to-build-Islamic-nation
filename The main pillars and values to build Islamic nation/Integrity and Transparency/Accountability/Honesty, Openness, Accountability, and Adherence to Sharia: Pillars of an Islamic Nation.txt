# Honesty, Openness, Accountability, and Adherence to Sharia: Pillars of an Islamic Nation

Taking steps towards building a nation demands the establishment and consolidation of core pillars. For an Islamic Nation, the pillars are sweeping, incorporating the Islamic Ummah, Muslim Identity, Democracy, Social Brotherhood, and more. Nevertheless, this article hones in on a set of fundamental principles that devise the structure for the nation's operation: Honesty, Openness, Accountability, and adherence to the Sharia Law.

## Honesty and Openness 

An Islamic nation is constructed on a foundation of honesty. Honesty in Public Service, Fair Treatment, and Ethical Behaviour are viewed as critical expressions of this principle. This implies that at all levels of the government and public sectors of an Islamic state, from the judiciary to the military, every decision made should be steered by morality and truthfulness.

Openness, a complementary principle to honesty, also holds a high priority. Transparent Decision Making, Freedom of Information, and Open Communication all come under its jurisdiction. For example, when governmental decisions are undertaken, processes are thoughtfully planned to guarantee they are free and unambiguous. This openness builds public trust and magnifies the efficacy of governance.

## Accountability & Adherence to Sharia 

Accountability in an Islamic Nation signifies Responsible Governance, a Results-oriented approach, and Ethical Leadership. These principles warrant that the power bearers are continually answerable for their decisions or actions. Responsible governance can range from holding public government meetings or meticulous financial oversight to avert mishandling of public funds.

Furthermore, adherence to Sharia Law is held in the highest esteem in an Islamic Nation. Law obedience is demonstrated through Respect for Sharia Law and Legal Responsibility. The judiciary is independent, guaranteeing everyone, irrespective of their status, complies with the law. An illustration of this core principle is holding public figures and officials answerable for misdeeds or transgressions of public trust.

In conclusion, the process of nation-building for an Islamic Nation rests upon these four principles: Honesty, Openness, Accountability, and adherence to Sharia Law. These pillars have carved the pathway for this nation, propelling it towards a democratic society that values the rights of every citizen and ardently works towards ensuring an environment where governance is held to the utmost standards.
