# Integrity and Transparency: Upholding the Rule of Law

Principles of integrity, transparency, and utmost respect for the rule of law are fundamental cornerstones in building our Islamic nation. They are so essential that without them, the foundations of a nation can easily crumble.

The rule of law is a doctrine in which everyone - individuals, organizations, and entities, is accountable to laws that are: publicly declared, impartially enforced, independently adjudicated, and in compliance with international human rights norms. At its core, the rule of law means that no individual, regardless of their position or role, is above the law.

Our Islamic nation upholds this concept, we ensure that everyone lives under the protection of law and has the right to legal recourses. For instance, no individual can be arbitrarily detained, nor can anyone be penalized for an act that was not considered illegal when it was committed. The law reigns supreme, not the arbitrary decisions of individuals.

Integrity and transparency, are two other pillars that we fervently uphold in our Islamic Ummah. Integrity in public service implies adherence to honesty and robust moral principles. A public official, for instance, must evade conflicts of interest, act impartially, refrain from misappropriation of public resources, and resist gifts that could question their integrity. Transparency, on the other hand, underscores that decision-making processes are open, clear, and that information is freely available to the public. For instance, when a new law is being crafted, the government holds open sessions for the public, and the final law is displayed on official websites for anyone to access.

It is the harmonious blend of these three values - respect for the rule of law, integrity, and transparency - that fosters a fair, open, and just society. This is the vision and goal we are pursuing in establishing and strengthening our Islamic nation.
