# Integrity and Transparency: The Pillar of Islamic Nation Building - Freedom of Information and Transparent Processes

The foundation of any nation rests on strong and unwavering pillars, and for an Islamic nation, Integrity and Transparency stand out as vital components. Within this pillar, Freedom of Information and Transparent Processes play a fundamental role.

## Freedom of Information

The Freedom of Information policy is a mechanism that enables the citizens of an Islamic nation to access a broad range of government resources and information. Its objective is to encourage openness, transparency and accountability while enabling citizens to understand how their representatives perform their duties.

An Islamic nation adheres to this principle in its governance, permitting citizens to access diverse forms of information in the public domain. As an example, any person, Muslim or not, can request access to records held by state authorities, subject to regulations.

This approach allows the citizens to remain informed and also scrutinize the activities of the government. It encourages a culture of transparency that combats corruption and the misuse of public resources.

## Transparent Processes

Transparent Processes serve a fundamental role in any democratic structure because they enable the public to witness procedures and participate in decision-making. Transparent governance further means that citizens can see exactly how decisions are made, resources assigned, and plans effectuated.

As part of its commitment to transparent processes, an Islamic nation ensures public contracts are properly supervised. For instance, all contracts for the provision of goods, services, and works by public authorities may be required to be awarded through a tender process that is fair, competitive, and transparent.

Furthermore, many Islamic nations have turned to digitalization of most government services, providing citizens an opportunity to directly participate in these processes. Services such as a unified digital government platform offer effortless access to governmental services, thereby reducing bureaucracy and costs while boosting efficiency.

## The Bottom Line

The Freedom of Information and Transparent Processes are not merely theoretical concepts in an Islamic nation. They are real-world practices that contribute to democratic governance, cultivate public trust, and enhance social cohesion. By embedding these principles in its nation-building efforts, an Islamic nation continues to uphold its high democratic standards grounded in the Islamic Ummah.
