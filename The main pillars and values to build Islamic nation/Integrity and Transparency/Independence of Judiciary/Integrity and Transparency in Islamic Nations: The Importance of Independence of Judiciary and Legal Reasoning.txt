# Integrity and Transparency in Islamic Nations: The Importance of Independence of Judiciary and Legal Reasoning

Grounding the creation and growth of Islamic nations are a multitude of pillars and values. Two of these, highly critical to their legal systems, are the independence of judiciary and legal reasoning. This article will explore the functions and significance of these principles, demonstrating their contribution to maintaining integrity and transparency.

## Independence of Judiciary

The independence of judiciary serves as an unshakeable cornerstone in an Islamic democracy. This signifies the institution of a balanced dynamic where the law applies equally to all, assuring every member of the Islamic Ummah equal rights. Such a principle is enshrined in Judicial Autonomy, where courts operate devoid of interference from the government or influential individuals.

This independence guarantees a Fair Trial for everyone, regardless of their socio-economic or political backgrounds. As an illustration, a common citizen and ahigh-ranking official would be subject to equal treatment under the law. Complying with Human Rights, the judiciary assures the protection and enforcement of individual rights and freedoms, depicting an embodiment of respect for human rights within Islamic nations.

The independence of the judiciary further sustains the rule of law, signifying the commitment towards Legal Certainty in Islamic nations. This is mainly carried out through Transparency in Practices within the judiciary. Trials, judgments, and decisions are all open to public observation which not only cultivates public trust but also serves as a warning to potential wrong-doers.

## Legal Reasoning

The second pillar, Legal Reasoning, delineates the thought process and methodology employed by judges in making their judgments. It's an integral element that assures Equality Before Law. It warrants that decisions are founded on case merits rather than personal biases, thereby aligning with the principle of Unbiased Judgment.

Legal reasoning also facilitates Access to Justice. The legal process becomes more understandable, aiding common people in comprehending the judicial decision-making processes. Judges explain the reasons behind every ruling, making the legal process more accessible and transparent to ordinary citizens. For example, the court's rationale in a property dispute case will make clear to the public the reasons behind the decision, strengthening confidence in the legal system.

Moreover, legal reasoning furthers the Right to Appeal. Comprehending the reasoning behind a judgment provides the victimized party an opportunity to contest it. In case they reason that there's been an oversight in the legal reasoning process, they possess the right to appeal against the decision.

## Conclusion

To conclude, the pillars of Independence of Judiciary and Legal Reasoning are vital to upholding integrity and transparency within Islamic nations. These principles instill public trust, uphold justice, and promote a culture of openness and transparency, indicative of the Islamic nations' commitment to a democratic, just, and transparent judicial process. These two elements take center stage in building the future of Islamic nations based on justice, fairness, and equality.
