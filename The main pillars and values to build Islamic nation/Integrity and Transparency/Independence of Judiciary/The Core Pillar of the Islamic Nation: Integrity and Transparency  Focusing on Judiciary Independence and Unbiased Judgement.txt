# The Core Pillar of the Islamic Nation: Integrity and Transparency - Focusing on Judiciary Independence and Unbiased Judgement

Every society is built upon certain key principles and values that foster a peaceful coexistence among its people. For the Islamic Ummah, these principles are rooted in major foundational pillars, one of which is 'Integrity and Transparency'. In particular, within this pillar, we spotlight the 'Independence of Judiciary' and 'Unbiased Judgement'. These two values are deeply interwoven and are essential to building and sustaining a just and reliable democratic community. 

## Defining Independence of Judiciary

The 'Independence of Judiciary' pertains to the principle where the judges are entrusted to function independently without any interference or control from executive or legislative influences. Within an Islamic society, courts accommodate a broad range of issues - from civil rights to criminal cases - without being swayed by political forces or personal affiliations. 

Thanks to this judicial autonomy, judges can conduct fair trials and deliver rulings based on empirical evidence and legal reasoning. This principle guarantees that all people, no matter their social status or background, are treated equitably under the law. An excellent example of when this is put into practice is when a high-ranking official is held accountable by the courts; it illustrates that everyone is subject to the same justice and nobody is above the law.

## Upholding Unbiased Judgement

Inextricably linked with the independence of the judiciary is the principle of 'Unbiased Judgement'. This principle embodies the belief that every legal case must be dealt with impartially, without any favouritism or bias. 

An 'Unbiased Judgement' dictates that judges should remain impartial in all their proceedings. They should base their decisions on facts, legal provisions, and their legal understanding, no matter the individual's religion, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status. It's not uncommon in Muslim courts to witness a judge rule against a well-connected figure; this shows the resilience and integrity of the judicial system.

A prime example of unbiased judgement in action can be seen in rulings where freedom of speech is upheld, disregarding its possible political consequences, thereby setting an important legal precedent in the society based on Islamic principles.

## Summing Up

The pillars of 'Independentity of Judiciary' and 'Unbiased Judgement' contribute significantly towards fortifying integrity and transparency within an Islamic society's administrative and societal setup. They work together to cultivate an environment where the rule of law is respected, and human rights are zealously protected. Commitment to these principles enables the preservation of democracy, ensuring that the Islamic Nation stands true to its ideals of justice, freedom, and equality.
