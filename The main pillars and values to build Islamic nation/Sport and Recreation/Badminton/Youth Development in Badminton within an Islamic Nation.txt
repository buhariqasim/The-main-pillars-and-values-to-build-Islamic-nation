## Impact of Youth Development

Youth development can help nurture a child's potential and provide an avenue for holistic learningâ€”teamwork, leadership, resilience, decision-making, and concentration. These elements help a child excel at badminton and prepare them for multiple facets of life. 

Additionally, a robust youth development program in badminton can enhance the Islamic nation's international standing in the sporting league.
