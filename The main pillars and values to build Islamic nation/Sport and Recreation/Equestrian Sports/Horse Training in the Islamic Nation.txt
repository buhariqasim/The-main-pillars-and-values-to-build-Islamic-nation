## Importance of Horse Training

In the Islamic nation, horse training is a vital pillar of Equestrian Sports. It creates a relationship between the horse and the rider that's based on trust, respect, and open communication. This process involves conditioning the horse, teaching it commands, grooming it for performances, and enhancing its physical strength and versatility.

Horse training also convey values of patience, compassion, and understanding. Riders learn to work with the horse's unique temperament and capabilities, fostering an environment of mutual respect and cooperation.
