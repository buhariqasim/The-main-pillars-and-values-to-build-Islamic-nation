### Use of Proper Gear

First and foremost, climbers should ensure they possess the correct climbing gear. This includes a helmet to shield the head, a harness for safety, carabiners for connector roles, belay devices for managing a rope, and suitable footwear that offers good grip on the rock.

### Regular Equipment Check

It is crucial to check your equipment regularly as well. Before embarking on a climb, perform checks on all knots, hardware and systems. Check the ropes to ensure they're not frayed and confirm that the helmet and harness buckles are secured properly.

### Bouldering Safely

When bouldering (a type of climbing performed without a rope at low elevations), it's important to have a spotter and a crash pad beneath you. The spotter can help to guide your fall onto the pad and ensure you land safely.
