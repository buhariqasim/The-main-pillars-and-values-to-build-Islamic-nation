# Lead Climbing: A Unique Aspect of Islamic Nation's Sport and Recreation

Lead Climbing, a thrilling form of rock climbing, is emerging as a notable sport in the Islamic Nation.

## What is Lead Climbing?

Lead Climbing is a mode of rock climbing in which a climber ascends a route while periodically clipping into pre-existing bolts with a rope for protection against falls. In contrast to top-roping, where a rope is already fixed at the summit, lead climbers carry the rope with them, continuously securing it as they climb.
