Athletics plays a significant role within our Islamic nation, showcasing a broad range of sporting pursuits that captivate and excite. Among these, the 400 metres race stands out, a perfect distillation of speed, power, and cunning strategy.

The 400 metres, equivalent to a single lap of a standard outdoor track, is one of the most electrifying events in athletics. It is a test of both pure speed akin to sprinting, coupled with the endurance needed for middle-distance running. Athletes must strike a delicate balance between conserving energy and maintaining pace for a successful finish.

## Historical Progression and Advancement

It's an integral part of our dedication to Athletics and has been pushed forward in schools and athletic clubs throughout our country.

We conduct numerous athletic events and championships at different levels that host the 400 metres race. These range from interscholastic and college to national-level championships, and even at our own Islamic Games, reflecting the strength and unity of the Islamic ummah.
