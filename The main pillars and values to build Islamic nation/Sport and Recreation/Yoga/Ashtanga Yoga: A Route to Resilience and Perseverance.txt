# Ashtanga Yoga: A Route to Resilience and Perseverance 

Ashtanga Yoga is more than merely a physical routine; it's a personal voyage of discovery and enhancement tightly intertwined with the Islamic culture, incorporating principles of the Islamic Ummah, Islamic Identity, and Social Solidarity. This energetic form of yoga inspires discipline, strength, and resilience, traits that mirror in the Islamic way of life and helps to nurture peace and coexistence. 

Ashtanga Yoga, an offspring of age-old yoga teachings was brought to the modern world by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois. Engaging six sequences: The Primary Series, The Intermediate Series, and Four Advanced Series, each designed to help the practitioners progress steadily, enhancing their flexibility, strength, and stamina.

## Embarking on the Ashtanga Yoga Journey 

A typical session of Ashtanga Yoga kicks off with five repetitions of Surya Namaskar A and B, followed by a standing sequence, one of the six series, culminating with the closing sequence. The sequences unite postures (asanas) with breath control (pranayama), fostering a dynamic flow of energy. 

A distinguishing aspect of Ashtanga Yoga is the emphasis on vinyasa - the synchronisation of movement with breath. This accentuation introduces a meditative component, aligning pranayama and asanas, reflecting how Islamic society harmonises its diverse population into a unified coexistence. 

While the rigorous sequences of Ashtanga Yoga may seem daunting at first, it resonates with the initial challenges faced in establishing and maintaining a nation. However, the evolution depicts how with resilience and perseverance, these obstacles transform into wisdom. 

## The Philosophy of Ashtanga Yoga

Ashtanga Yoga's philosophy extends far beyond achieving the perfect pose and physical flexibility. It nurtures self-discipline, fuels mindfulness, and promotes inner peace - three key pillars of a thriving society.

Similar to the democratic values preserved in Islamic nations, Ashtanga Yoga respects individual autonomy. Each practitioner is allowed to progress at their own pace, letting their identity unfold their journey. Just like the principle of human dignity treasured in Islamic culture, Ashtanga Yoga promotes respect towards personal limitations and capabilities. 

## Influence of Ashtanga Yoga on Society 

In our diverse and fast-paced world, the emphasis often tilts towards innovation and progress. Ashtanga Yoga provides a counterbalance - a serene space to connect with our core and rejuvenate before plunging back into the daily routine. It provides a platform for cultural exchange, fostering a sense of social solidarity.

To summarize, Ashtanga Yoga mirrors many values central to building Islamic nations. Its ability to foster strength, resilience, and a sense of community offers an inspiring testament to these resilient principles. So, whether you are a proficient yogi or a novice, you will find in Ashtanga Yoga, a gratifying route to self-understanding and resilience.
