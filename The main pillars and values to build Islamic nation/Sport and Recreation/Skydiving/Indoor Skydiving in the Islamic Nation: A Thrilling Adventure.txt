From thrill-seekers to those seeking a novel experience, indoor skydiving offers everyone the exhilarating sensation of freefalling without needing to jump out of a plane.

## Understanding Indoor Skydiving

Indoor skydiving, also known as bodyflight, simulates the phenomena of freefalling. Enthusiasts float in a vertical wind tunnel with upward gusts of air at about 120 mph. This powerful updraft allows you to float in mid-air.

Indoor skydiving eliminates many obstacles associated with traditional skydiving, including weather dependencies and acrophobia. It is a safe and exhilarating activity that welcomes all age groups—from eager young children to older folks intrigued by a new experience.
