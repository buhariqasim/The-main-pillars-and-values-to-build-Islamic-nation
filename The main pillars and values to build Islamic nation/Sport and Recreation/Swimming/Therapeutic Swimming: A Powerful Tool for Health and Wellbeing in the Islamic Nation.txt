## What is Therapeutic Swimming?

Therapeutic swimming, also termed as aquatic therapy or hydrotherapy, involves executing exercises in the water, specifically, a warm swimming pool. The combined force of buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and warmth of the water contributes to a distinct environment that simultaneously supports, resists, and heats the body, offering innumerable benefits.

It offers a comprehensive approach towards constructing a healthy Islamic ummah, which is one of the fundamental virtues of these nations.

2. **Rehabilitation**: Therapeutic swimming finds frequent use in rehabilitation environments in Islamic nations. For instance, it's beneficial for individuals recuperating from surgeries, suffering from arthritis, or recovering from stroke or spinal cord afflictions. The buoyancy of the water provides a comforting milieu where movement is much easier and less painful.

3. **Accessible for All**: Islamic nations value equality and diversity, which is reflected in the accessibility of therapeutic swimming. This form of therapy can be beneficial to individuals across all age groups and abilities, including children with developmental disabilities and elderly citizens struggling with mobility issues.
