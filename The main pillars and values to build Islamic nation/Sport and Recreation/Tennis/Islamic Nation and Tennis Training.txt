Islamic nations stand for equality and inclusiveness. These principles are reflected in the way tennis is trained and played. Regardless of age, gender or physical ability, tennis is a sport for all. Special emphasis is made on inclusivity, leading to the promotion of wheelchair tennis and other adaptive forms of the sport.
