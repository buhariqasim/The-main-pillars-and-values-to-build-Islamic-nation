# Disability-Friendly Construction in Islamic Nations: Building a More Inclusive Ummah

Ensuring dignified living conditions for every individual, regardless of their physical abilities, is fundamental in the principles of equality and social solidarity within the Islamic ummah. Disability-friendly construction, in this respect, has become an indispensable part of the housing sector across Islamic nations. We are staunchly committed to creating societies where disabled persons are valued, supported, and included in every aspect of daily life.

## Unpacking Disability-Friendly Construction

Disability-friendly construction involves creating accessible and safe spaces for people with disabilities. This approach adopts design and architectural elements that are intended to provide easier access, promote unhindered mobility, and cater to various needs specific to people with disabilities. From wheelchair-accessible entrances and spacious rooms for easy maneuverability, to user-friendly facilities and fixtures - every detail counts towards establishing a disability-friendly household.

## The Significance

Every individual, including those with disabilities, deserves to live with comfort and autonomy. Homes that feature disability-friendly elements allow disabled individuals to lead lives with enhanced ease and independence, which in turn improves their quality of life and promotes active participation in society.

## Disability-Friendly Construction in Islamic Homes

Across the Islamic nations, disability-friendly construction is no longer a choice but a necessity. To uphold our commitment to social solidarity and equality, most Islamic countries ardently advocate for strict accessibility standards in both private and public housing sectors.

For instance, all new residential buildings must be equipped with ramps or lifts to provide wheelchair access. Homes need to have wide doorways and corridors, and if the homes are for first-time owners, they must be on ground level to facilitate access. Additionally, bathrooms are required to be adapted for easy usage by wheelchair users, with all switches and controls placed at reachable heights.

Housing assistance programs in the Islamic countries also support residents who need to adapt existing homes to make them more disability-friendly. The expenses for ramps and adjustable kitchen and bathroom facilities can be covered under these programs.

Such accommodations might include:

- Ramps or stairlifts replacing entrance steps
- Lever-style door handles that replace twist knobs
- Adjustable kitchen countertops and storage spaces
- Grab bars in bathrooms
- Visual and tactile alert systems (flashing light doorbells, braille numbers on elevator buttons, etc.)

## The Importance of Complying with Accessibility Standards

Ensuring quality and safety, the governing bodies in Islamic nations have implemented stringent accessibility standards for construction. These regulations are in place to ensure renovations, alterations, and even new constructions cater to the needs and safety of individuals with disabilities. It is essential for builders and property owners to adhere to these standards, not just for legal compliance, but to contribute to a more inclusive and accessible society.

## Envisioning a more inclusive future

Disability-friendly construction paves the way for a more inclusive Islamic ummah. This thoughtful initiative benefits individuals with disabilities, the elderly, pregnant women, parents with strollers, and anyone else with unique mobility needs. We inch closer to a society where, regardless of their challenges, everyone can lead dignified and independent lives. After all, the strength of the ummah lies in its ability to support its most vulnerable members.
