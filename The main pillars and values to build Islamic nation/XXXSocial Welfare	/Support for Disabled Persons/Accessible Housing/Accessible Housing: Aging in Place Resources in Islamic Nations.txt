# Accessible Housing: Aging in Place Resources in Islamic Nations

Harnessing resources for aging in place is pivotal in ensuring a commendable quality of life for people with disabilities. Islamic nations are steadily concentrating on constructing homes that empower everyone, regardless of physical capability, to enjoy an autonomous lifestyle with dignity and comfort.

## What is Aging in Place?

"Aging in place" is a term that describes an individual living in their chosen residence, for as long as they can manage, as they age, including having any support or services they might need over time as their circumstances change. In terms of accessible housing, it means strategizing and initiating adaptations to houses that empower disabled individuals to live as per their choice and to avoid transitioning into specialized institutions or nursing homes.
