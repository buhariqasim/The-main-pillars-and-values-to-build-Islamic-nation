# Sensory Friendly Housing Designs in Islamic Nations

Sensory friendly housing designs are an invaluable provision that paves the way for creating more accessible and inclusive residential environments for persons with sensory disabilities such as autism, blindness, deafness, among others. As a crucial value in advancing the Islamic Ummah, it is of great importance to raise awareness on this matter and carefully integrate it within our housing structures.

## Understanding Sensory Friendly Housing 

Sensory friendly housing refers to housing designs that are especially crafted to cater to the unique needs of people with sensory disabilities. These designs are calculatingly attentive to factors such as lighting, auditory conditions, textures, color selections, and spatial configurations that can influence an individual's sensory interaction with their environment.

For example, a sensory friendly design for a person with autism may involve the utilization of soothing colors, low noise appliances, lights with dimming options, and smooth textures that can help prevent overstimulation. In contrast, if someone has a visual impairment, the design might necessitate sharp, contrasting colors for higher visibility and textured floorings for risk-free navigation.

## Importance in Islamic Society

Islamic societies, in their pursuit of justice, equality, and social unity, hold high regard for the rights and freedoms of every individual. Thus, it is a fundamental principle that housing facilities are developed with a holistic approach, ensuring they are accessible and suitable for everyone, including those with sensory disabilities.

Sensory friendly housing aligns well with the Islamic Ummah's overarching value of inclusion and diversity. It recognizes the distinct needs of each individual and ensures they can feel comfortable and accommodated within their homes. Such designs donâ€™t just support the independence of disabled persons but also foster their integration in communal life, standing firm by their rights for equal treatment and opportunities.

## Examples in Practice

There are numerous instances of sensory-friendly designs in practice within Islamic nations. Organizations that focus on enabling access to natural environments for disabled individuals, embody the idea of sensory-friendly design into open spaces. For instance, they may create sensory gardens filled with varied textures, fragrances, and sounds to enrich the experiences of disabled individuals.

Regarding residential spaces, various organizations and construction companies across the Islamic world echoes sensory friendly design principles. For instance, apartments may feature tactile floorings and lighting that can be dimmed or have color temperature controls. This offers a spectrum of options to create a comfortable and relaxing environment. Moreover, utilizing quiet appliances and construction materials that reduce noise can also lessen auditory overstimulation.

## Conclusion

Ensuring sensory-friendly housing is paramount to supporting disabled persons in Islamic nations. By endorsing such housing designs, these nations continue to affirm their core values of equality, inclusion, and mutual respect. As our societal architecture evolves to be more sensory-friendly, we stride forward in lifting architectural barriers and reinforcing our belief that every individual deserves a living space that not just supports their wellbeing but markedly enhances their quality of life.
