# Accessible Housing and Housing Discrimination Protection for Disabled Persons in Islamic Nations

At the heart of Islamic Ummah values is the tenet of *Equality*. It spreads across various aspects of society, one crucial component being the provision and protection of housing rights for disabled individuals. This is a key facet of the Islamic nation's continuous support for disabled persons.

## What is Accessible Housing?

Accessible housing refers to dwellings designed or adapted to accommodate the needs of people who experience disability, enabling them to live independently. It comprises customised features such as wheelchair ramps, flexible countertops, wider doorways or adapted bathroom fittings. The objective is to provide a safe, comfortable, and user-friendly environment, designed to mitigate physical limitations and foster independence.

## Accessible Housing in Islamic Nations

In Islamic nations, accessibility of housing is a legally safeguarded right. National law mandates that all housing units, public or private, conform to the set standards of accessibility. This includes the provision of suitable homes in aided living facilities, the incorporation of a barrier-free design in new constructions, and undertaking modifications in existing houses. This spans across a variety of needs, from residential home modifications such as ramp, lift, or handrail installations, to broader scale infrastructure such as walkways or parking facilities.

Take for example housing projects similar to the **Al Falah Housing Project** in Riyadh, which emphasises the commitment to accessible housing in these nations. It offers tailored and adapted accommodation for disabled individuals, utilising the finest architectural and design methodologies to construct an environment free of barriers.

## Housing Discrimination Protection

Islamic nations affirm the right of disabled individuals to be insulated from discrimination in the housing market. This protection is upheld by law, which unequivocally states disability as a category against which landlords or property owners cannot discriminate. This means that landlords are prohibited from refusing to rent or sell a property to an individual based on their disabilities.

Moreover, the legal framework in Islamic nations includes an **Equal Opportunities in Employment Law** which ensures that an employee with a disability is entitled to accessible company housing, should it form part of their employment benefits.

Through concentrating on accessible housing and housing discrimination protection, Islamic nations not only foster social solidarity but also preserve the dignity and freedom of disabled individuals, nurturing a society rich in diversity, equality, and justice. These urgent and essential measures ensure that our nations continue to develop into a more inclusive and socially empathetic Islamic society.
