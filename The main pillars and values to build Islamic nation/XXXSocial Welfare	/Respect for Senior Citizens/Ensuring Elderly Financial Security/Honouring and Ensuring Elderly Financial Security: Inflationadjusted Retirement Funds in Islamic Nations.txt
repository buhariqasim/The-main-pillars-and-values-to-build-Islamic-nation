# Honouring and Ensuring Elderly Financial Security: Inflation-adjusted Retirement Funds in Islamic Nations

A fundamental aspect of demonstrating respect for senior citizens within the Islamic Ummah includes guaranteeing their financial stability during the autumn years of their lives. Safeguarding elderly financial security is an affirmation of the continuous contributions they've rendered to the society and economy. It upholds their dignity and respect, in line with the Islamic teachings of honouring the elderly. A pivotal dimension of guaranteeing elderly financial security is the establishment of "Inflation-adjusted Retirement Funds."

## What are Inflation-adjusted Retirement Funds?

Inflation-adjusted retirement funds are bespoke financial measures designed to adjust with the fluctuating cost of living, or inflation. Their primary aim is to ensure that the value of the benefits accessible to senior citizens during their retirement embodies the real-time cost of living.

## Why are they Important?

Let's consider a scenario: Mr. Ahmed retired in the year 2000, having a retirement fund promising a fixed monthly amount. As years pass, the cost of living increases because of inflation. However, if his retirement fund does not account for this inflation, his purchasing power diminishes. In effect, his fund offers a lower monetary value, leading Mr. Ahmed towards potential financial difficulties. Regrettably, this is not an outcome he intended for his retirement.

Islamic nations have recognized the significance of inflation-adjusted retirement funds to avoid these circumstances. Such funds endeavor to maintain the worth of the retirement benefits received by the elderly in line with the present cost of living, providing the financial security they need and are entitled to.

## Key Features of Inflation-adjusted Retirement Funds

Inflation-adjusted retirement funds in Islamic nations generally encompass two key facets:

1. The funds auto-adjust concerning the inflation rate, ensuring that the benefit's value received by senior citizens corresponds to the prevailing cost of living.

2. In situations of deflation, most inflation-adjusted retirement funds in Islamic nations guarantee that the value of the benefits remains static, acting as a financial safety net for senior citizens.

## Conclusion

The commitment to elderly financial security, epitomized by provisions like inflation-adjusted retirement funds, is central to the values of Islamic Ummah. It enables the elderly to sustain their lifestyle without their monetary resources being depleted by inflation over the years.

Indeed, a nation that values its older generation lays the foundations for a promising and prosperous future, as it guides its present by learning from the past's wisdom.
