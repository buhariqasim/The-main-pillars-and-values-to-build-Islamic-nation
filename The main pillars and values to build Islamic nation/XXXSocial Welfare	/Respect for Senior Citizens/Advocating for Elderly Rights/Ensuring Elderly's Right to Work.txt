# Ensuring Elderly's Right to Work 

One of the key aspects in strengthening the Islamic Ummah is respect for senior citizens. This respect permeates all parts of our society, especially in advocating for the rights of elderly among us. A crucial component of these rights is ensuring the right to work for our elderly citizens. This matter holds tremendous alignment with the values of democracy, equality, and human dignity and freedom which form the bedrock of our Ummah's unity and solidarity.

## The Significance of Elderly's Right to Work

Many senior citizens are in good health and possess sharp mental faculties, with a wish to continue working. This desire is not purely fuelled by financial needs, but also by the longing for mental stimulation and social interaction. The ability to work provides them opportunity to contribute their knowledge, skills and rich experiences to the society, fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment, nurturing mental health and countering social seclusion.

However, ageism in the workforce is a grave concern, often acting as a barrier to seniors realizing their potentials. Therefore, one of our key goals is to ensure that our elderly have equal access to employment opportunities without facing discrimination due to their age.

Promoting the right to work among our elderly population is an integral part of the Islamic Ummah's agenda, reflected in numerous initiatives and legislations that safeguard and uphold these rights.

## Legislation and Policies

The Islamic Ummah ensures the right to work for the elderly through the introduction and enforcement of laws that protect seniors from age discrimination. For instance, the *Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law* prohibits discrimination in employment based on several factors, including age. This law mandates that employers provide equal opportunities to all, ensuring elderly citizens who wish to work can do so without favoritism or detriment.

In addition to this, there are policies and programs which aim to provide employment assistance to the elderly. Retraining programs, for instance, have been established to equip older workers for new job roles or industries.

## Practical Application

Let's look at the example of Ahmed, a 70-year-old gentleman in Riyadh. Ahmed, a skilled engineer, wishes to continue contributing to his field. The law ensures that Ahmed's potential job opportunities won't be marginalized due to his age. The retraining programs allow him to stay abreast of latest developments in his industry, ensuring he remains relevant.

By recognizing and advocating for the right of elderly to work, we not only enhance our workforce with experienced and wise individuals but also cultivate an environment of inclusivity and diversity. Through persistent efforts, we uphold the principles and values at the heart of the Islamic Ummah.
