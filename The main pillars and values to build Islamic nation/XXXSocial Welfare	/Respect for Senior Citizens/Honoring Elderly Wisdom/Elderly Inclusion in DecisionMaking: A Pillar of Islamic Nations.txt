# Elderly Inclusion in Decision-Making: A Pillar of Islamic Nations

An Islamic nation, guided by foundational values like Islamic Ummah, Muslim identity, democracy, and the rule of law, derives strength from its socio-cultural diversity. A crucial part of this vibrant tapestry is the invaluable wisdom and life experiences of its senior citizens. Islamic societies place a premium on the role of these seasoned citizens, especially in decision-making, aligning with its commitment to social solidarity, equality, and respect for all. This approach not only ensures broader diversity in decisions, but also guarantees that senior citizens are integrally involved, actively contributing to shaping the future rather than merely observing the present.

## Respecting Elderly Wisdom

Senior citizens carry a lifetime of experiences, yielding a depth of insights that might be unavailable to younger generations. This wisdom, encapsulated in countless life lessons, is a wealth of guidance for insightful decisions that can greatly impact society. For instance, many have lived through significant historical periods like the establishment of an Islamic Republic or major socio-political changes, providing them with unparalleled perspectives.

## Facilitating Intergenerational Discourse

Encouraging elderly involvement promotes an intergenerational discourse where young and old contribute mutually. This dialogue initiates the flow of diverse ideas, perspectives, and solutions enhancing the decision-making arena with both innovative solutions and time-tested wisdom. An example is a technological start-up where a senior board member provides prudential insights, and a younger member brings in fresh, novel ideas.

## Gleaning Insights from the Past to Guide the Future

Including elderly experiences in decision-making assists societies in avoiding the repetition of historical missteps. For instance, seniors with their personal encounter of historical events, conflicts, or social changes may provide insightful advice during key decisions, positively influencing the trajectory of future actions.

## Conclusion

Creating opportunities for our elderly in decision-making processes goes beyond respect and inclusion; it's a strategic asset for nations pursuing comprehensive growth. As the Islamic nations continue this practice, the core ethos of the society - equality, social solidarity, and respect for every citizen, regardless of age, is reinforced.
