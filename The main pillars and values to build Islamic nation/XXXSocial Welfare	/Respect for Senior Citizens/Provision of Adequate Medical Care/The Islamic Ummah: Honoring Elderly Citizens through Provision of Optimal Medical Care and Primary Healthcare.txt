## The Islamic Ummah: Honoring Elderly Citizens through Provision of Optimal Medical Care and Primary Healthcare 

The Islamic Ummah has imbibed principles of honoring and caring for its elderly citizens, respecting both their wisdom and lifelong contributions to society. One of the guiding principles of the Islamic nation is to ensure that in their later years, these esteemed members of our society have unfettered access to top-tier medical care, spanning preventative and curative health services.

### Decoding the Concept of Optimal Medical Care 

Understanding optimal medical care extends beyond simply having access to medical facilities. It is multifaceted and includes access to timely, efficient, and high-caliber health services. In line with the Islamic principles of caring for elders, it becomes essential to ensure their access to these services, especially as health threats intensify with age. 

Consider Mr. Abbas, an 82-year-old resident of Riyadh, who suffers from hypertension and diabetes, he receives swift medical assistance at local healthcare clinics. Frequent check-ups, required medications, and diet-based consultation are swiftly provided to him to control his conditions.

### The Crucial Role of Primary Healthcare 

Primary healthcare serves as the first contact individuals, families, and communities make with the healthcare system. It caters to numerous health requirements throughout life, including prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and end-of-life care. This makes ensuring the unhindered access of senior citizens to primary healthcare crucial in accomplishing their overall health and welfare.

Mrs. Fatima, a 75-year-old citizen from Istanbul, is well benefited from the state-run annual health examination programs. These screenings – cholesterol, blood pressure, and sugar level tests – aid in early detection of potential health problems, paving the way for timely intervention.

### The Islamic Approach

Endowing the elderly with optimal medical care requires a multifaceted strategy in the Islamic world. Across various Islamic nations, hospitals and health centers are equipped to offer services tailored to treat various conditions, with a distinctive emphasis on geriatric care. These service ranges include specialty care, mental health services, end-of-life care, and rehabilitation services. 

The Islamic community recognizes the value of health education and preventive care. Early detection and regular monitoring are key components in managing long-term health conditions. Telemedicine has become significantly embraced to monitor health conditions and offer consultations remotely, providing comfort and convenience for the elderly.

#### The Duty of the Ummah

The devotion to elderly citizens’ health runs deeper than being an approach – it's a commitment, a duty that the Islamic Ummah acknowledges and ardently upholds. This is a reflection of the respect shown toward the seniors, a testament to the strong principles on which the Islamic nation stands — values that mark it as a nation that acknowledges, cares for, and respects its senior members.

Providing care for our elderly is not merely confined to medical treatment. It encompasses safeguarding their dignity, social inclusion, and recognizing their value as our guiding light - a beacon navigating the path for younger generations. They are the custodians of our shared experiences, the guardians of our heritage, and the proponents of our common values. Together, we uphold the spirit of the Islamic Ummah — of compassion, respect, and championing the rights of its elders.
