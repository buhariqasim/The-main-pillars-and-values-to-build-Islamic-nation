# The Pillars of the Islamic Ummah: Reverence for Elderly and Wealth and Income Equality

The vision behind the robust Islamic Ummah, embracing values such as democracy, security, and resilience, is governed by significant cornerstone principles. Among them, two core tenets shine brightly due to their profound societal impact - Reverence for the Elderly and Wealth and Income Equality.

## Honoring our Elders

The Islamic Ummah greatly respects the contributions of older members of the community. This appreciation displays itself in a multitude of ways 

1. **Cherishing Elders' Wisdom**: The elderly in the Islamic community are treated with immense respect, and their wisdom is avidly sought after in various areas of life. Their life experiences provide invaluable insights and lessons, guiding newer generations.

2. **Promoting Lifelong Learning**: The practice of continuous learning is highly encouraged amongst the elderly within the Islamic Ummah. This not only enriches their lives but also enables them to contribute their insights more effectively to society.

3. **Providing Sufficient Medical Care**: The Islamic Ummah ensures its senior community members have access to the best imaginable medical care. This includes chiropractic health exams, specialized health services, and therapeutic treatments.

4. **Financial Security**: Measures have been put in place to ensure the financial security of the elderly within the Islamic Ummah. These include pensions, retirement savings plans, and social security benefits.

## Striving for Wealth and Income Equality

In addition to revering the elderly, the Islamic Ummah is as committed to eradicating wealth and income disparities.

1. **Transparent Governance**: The Islamic Ummah ensures its economic policies are transparent, inclusive, fair, and designed to promote equal opportunities. The legal framework guarantees equal rights to all, irrespective of their social or economic background.

2. **Employment Opportunities**: Key indicators of economic equality include the availability of job opportunities. The Islamic Ummah guarantees job opportunities for all its members, ensuring anyone willing and able to work can secure employment.

3. **Education Opportunities**: Most importantly, the Islamic Ummah places high value on education as the most effective tool in breaking the cycle of poverty. Thus, it facilitates universal access to quality education.

4. **Social-economic policies**: The Islamic Ummah continually works to adopt socio-economic policies that diminish income and wealth divisions. It promotes equal benefits for everyone so that each member of the community shares the prosperity of the Ummah.

By cherishing these values, the Islamic Ummah aspires to foster a society where every member – irrespective of their age or economic stances – is treated with dignity and respect and has an equal opportunity to contribute to the progress of the Ummah.
