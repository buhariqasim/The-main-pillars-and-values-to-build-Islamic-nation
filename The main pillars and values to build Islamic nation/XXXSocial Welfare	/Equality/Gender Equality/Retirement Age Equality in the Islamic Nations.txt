# Retirement Age Equality in the Islamic Nations

One of the guiding principles in the establishment of the Islamic nations is Equality. A specific dimension that merits attention is Gender Equality, notably, Retirement Age Equality. The fundamental idea here is that both men and women should have equivalent rights and privileges pertaining to retirement from their careers. 

In the Islamic nations, equality in retirement age is considered a right, not a luxury. The judicial system within these nations encourages a uniform retirement age for both genders. Although the specific age for retirement varies between nations, there is a common understanding to review and aim for harmonization in policies to promote gender equality. 

## Importance of Retirement Age Equality

Moving away from the traditional perception of older men as the main breadwinners, a growing number of women in these nations continue to be professionally active well into their seventies. Aligning the retirement age for men and women not only recognizes the physical and mental capabilities of women to work in their later years but also respects their right to decide their retirement time.

Retirement age equality plays a crucial role in narrowing the gender pay gap. If women retire later, they receive pension benefits for a shorter period resulting in less total pension compared to men. By having the same retirement age for both sexes, it ensures that they can both retire with equivalent pension benefits.

In the broader perspective of gender equality, having the same retirement age also signifies identical socio-economic roles. Offering women the same retirement age as men, we recognize that all genders are equally capable of contributing to the workforce, economy, and society.

## Progress Towards Retirement Age Equality

While there is still a difference in the retirement ages of men and women, it is important to note the progress made in these areas within the Islamic nations. Over recent years, there has been an increase in the percentage of older women choosing to remain in the workforce. 

Furthermore, policymakers and organizations within these nations are advocating for retirement age equality, arguing that uniform retirement age is a crucial stepping-stone towards complete gender equality. Consistent emphasis on retirement age equality and similar initiatives allow Islamic nations to reinforce their core principle of equality, particularly gender equality. 

Striving towards a more equal society involves commitment to equal opportunities and rights for all, regardless of gender. Retirement age equality is one method of ensuring that all share equally in the benefits of a prosperous, diverse, and vibrant Islamic Ummah.
