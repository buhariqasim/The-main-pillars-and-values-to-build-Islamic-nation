# Advancing Women's Rights: Combating Gender-Based Violence in Islamic Nations

Built upon principles of justice, equity and honour, Islamic nations value the indispensable role women play in society and constantly strive to improve their rights, freedoms, and ensure their safety and well-being. Advocating and advancing women's rights is a crucial aspect of the Islamic Ummah's ethos. An instrumental part of this endeavour is centred around combating the pervasive issue of gender-based violence (GBV).

## Decoding Gender-Based Violence  

GBV is a widespread problem, affecting individuals across all cultures, demographic groups, and socio-economic levels, predominantly women and girls. It includes physical, sexual, mental, or economic harm inflicted on an individual due to deeply entrenched societal norms and beliefs about their gender. Regrettably, instances of GBV are not absent from Islamic societies, necessitating determined efforts to tackle and diminish it.

## Approach of Islamic Nations: Activism, Legislation and Preemptive Measures

In the battle against GBV, Islamic nations employ numerous strategies including policy shifts, legal propositions and educational drives. They have bolstered their legal systems to provide better protection for victims, penalize offenders and dissuade potential culprits. This includes laws that define and penalize different forms of GBV, such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, trafficking and others.

Islamic nations have also prioritized the formation of a supportive environment for GBV victims. Numerous public and private entities provide support services such as hotlines, safe havens, counselling and legal guidance. Women-centric organizations work tirelessly to render aid to victims, push for stricter laws and raise public awareness about gender-based violence.

Prevention of GBV is also a top priority in Islamic nations' quest to improve women's lives. This involves efforts aimed at challenging and transforming societal norms and attitudes, primarily through education. By integrating topics like gender equality, respect, and non-violence into school curricula, Islamic nations aim to nurture future generations that repudiate GBV.

## Future Direction

There's a substantial journey ahead in Islamic nations' mission to combat GBV. To advance women's rights, relentless efforts are required to understand the evolving nature of GBV, enhance response mechanisms, and create a culture of respect and equality. With the advancement in technology, newer strategies can be developed to better assist victims and offer timely help.

The struggle against GBV, integral to fostering women's rights, is a collective responsibility. From legislators to educators, from non-profit organizations to each individual, everyone has a significant role to play in this endeavour. By standing together in this struggle, Islamic nations can ensure a more secure, inclusive society, embodying true values of the Islamic Ummah.
