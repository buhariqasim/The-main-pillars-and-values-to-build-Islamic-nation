# The Main Pillars and Values to Build Islamic Nations: Democracy, Decentralization, and Accountability

Crafting a nation-state requires significant groundwork, crucially dependent on indispensable pillars and values which underpin the nation's evolution and help carve its unique identity. For Islamic nations, these cornerstone ideas are democracy, decentralization of powers, and a keen sense of accountability.

## Democracy

In the broad context of Islamic nations, elements of democracy can be seen in the form of Shura, or consultation, a principle deeply entrenched in Islamic law. This extends to equal voting rights, freedom of speech, respect for human rights, and political pluralism among other foundational democratic principles. 

Islamic nations hold public consultations, also known as Shura, where discussions and deliberations take place over various issues, mimicking the participatory democracy model. Every citizen, irrespective of their gender, ethnicity, or religious orientation, can partake equally in these Shura, fostering a sense of equal representation.

The principle of freedom of speech is also a tenet enthusiastically encouraged in Islamic societies. Muslims are urged to voice their thoughts, views, and constructive criticisms, ensuring a lively and vibrant public sphere. As an example, Muslim scholars and leaders often engage in constructive debates and discussions, reflecting the society's dynamic nature.

## Decentralization of Powers

The concept of decentralization of power is pivotal in the building process of Islamic nations. This implies the dispersion of power from centralized authority to subnational government levels. Islamic nations often operate on a multi-tiered system of governance.

Local governance, for instance, plays an essential role in decision-making processes at the community level, dealing with issues like town planning, environmental preservation, or welfare programs. These decentralized frameworks enable citizens to partake in decision-making processes which ensures their specific needs are taken into account and addressed in the best possible manner.

## Accountability 

Accountability forms a core part of governance within Islamic nations, ensuring those in power, ranging from political leaders to public servants, answer for their actions and decisions.

The principle of accountability, or Mas'uliya, is strictly ingrained in Islamic doctrine. Authorities are responsible not only to people but also to God, which fosters a sense of integrity and honesty in governance. For example, many Islamic nations have independent committees which regularly appraise the actions of the government and ensure transparency and legality in public service.

In conclusion, democracy, decentralization, and accountability are fundamental pillars in the nation-building process of an Islamic nation. These values are embedded within social, political, and economic structures of Islamic societies, fostering an environment of diversity, law-abiding citizens, and social justice. They underscore the Islamic Ummah's commitment to crafting a society that is open, equitable, and well-governed.
