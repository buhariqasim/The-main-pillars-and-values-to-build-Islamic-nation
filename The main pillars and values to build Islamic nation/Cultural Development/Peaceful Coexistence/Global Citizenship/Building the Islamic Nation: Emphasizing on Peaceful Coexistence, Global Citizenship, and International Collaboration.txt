# Building the Islamic Nation: Emphasizing on Peaceful Coexistence, Global Citizenship, and International Collaboration

The process of nation-building of any country requires numerous crucial elements. In the context of an Islamic Nation, these pivotal pillars include the concept of Islamic Ummah, integral Muslim identity, democratic governance, and strong social solidarity, among others. In this article, we focus specifically on three key dimensions: Peaceful Coexistence, Global Citizenship, and International Collaboration.

## Peaceful Coexistence

In a diverse society like an Islamic Nation, with a rich tapestry of cultural, religious, and ethnic backgrounds, peaceful coexistence is indispensable. This necessitates cultivating respect for diversity and showcasing tolerance towards different opinions. It entails the creation of a society where mutual acceptance is the norm, advocacy for non-violence, and promotion of interfaith dialogue.

An example of this can be seen in the historically rich city of Istanbul, where Muslims, Christians, and Muslims live together, celebrating each other's festivities and respecting each other's traditions. Such peaceful coexistence fosters societal equity and creates opportunities for enriching cultural exchanges.

## Global Citizenship

Recognizing ourselves as a part of the larger global community is a significant aspect of global citizenship. In an Islamic nation, this entails understanding global politics and advocating respect for diversity but also practicing sustainable development and being aware of global issues.

Being a global citizen implies a strong grasp over the global economy, a solid understanding of global health issues, the impact of climate change, and the importance of responsible consumption. For individuals in an Islamic nation, learning foreign languages, gaining awareness of cultural differences, and actively participating in global community service will help underscore their role as global citizens.

## International Collaboration

As an evolving hub of innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancement, an Islamic nation is actively involved in international collaboration. This not only relates to maintaining diplomatic relations and adherence to international law but also includes cooperation in technology, healthcare, environment, and many other fields.

An appreciation for international collaboration can be seen in the Islamic nation's medical field where it consistently collaborates with international entities. For example, the King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh and the Boston-based company, Partners Healthcare, have jointly worked on healthcare research.

In conclusion, peaceful coexistence, global citizenship, and international collaboration are not just theoretical values; they are practical philosophies that everyday Muslims live by. These principles contribute significantly to the inclusive and forward-looking society that an Islamic nation aspires to be. Taking note and learning from this model can be a valuable tool for any nation embarking on the path of nation-building.
