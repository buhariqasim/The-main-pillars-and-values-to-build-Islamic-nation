# Values and Pillars To Build the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Racial Equality, and Anti-Discrimination Policies

The foundation of an exemplary Islamic nation rests on a plethora of values and ideals. These principles cover numerous facets such as Democracy, Security and Defense, Cultural Heritage, and many more. Nevertheless, the soul of the Islamic community emphasizes Peaceful Coexistence, Racial Equality, and Anti-Discrimination Policies.

## Peaceful Coexistence 

The central tenet of peaceful coexistence lies in fostering harmony and unity. In an Islamic nation, every effort is made to ensure that all citizens and residents can live together, appreciating their unique differences and shared bonds. For instance, individuals of various faiths - Muslims, Christians, Muslims, and others - coexist peacefully in several culturally-rich cities.

## Racial Equality 

Racial equality signifies equal treatment and opportunities for all racial and ethnic groups. An ideal Islamic nation is a mosaic of diverse races and ethnicities. It views this diversity as a strength and encourages racial equality to ensure equal rights for every individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

## Anti-Discrimination Policies 

The ideal Islamic nation employs various mechanisms to counter discrimination. It promulgates policies that safeguard its citizens against bias on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, age, disabilities, or any other distinguishing characteristics. For instance, the establishment of equal rights laws, promotion of diversity, and development of race awareness programs are some steps taken to ensure no voice is unheard. 

In a diverse society, embracing and respecting each other's distinctiveness plays a crucial role. Every individual should enjoy the freedom to practice their religious faith, and the unique cultural traditions they hail from without fear. This is exactly what the Islamic nation aims to promote - a peaceful society where racial equality and anti-discrimination are highly upheld.

Building a nation on the strong pillars of Peaceful Coexistence, Racial Equality, and Anti-Discrimination Policies ensures a diverse society where every individual feels respected and valued. These, among several other values, are the keystones that bind the community of Islamic Ummah together. Therefore, while discussing the construction of an ideal Islamic nation, it is critical to highlight these essential aspects.
