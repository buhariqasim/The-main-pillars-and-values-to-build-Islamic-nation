# Pillars and Values to Build An Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Understanding and Empathy, Constructive Communication

An Islamic nation is centered on a plethora of principles and values which celebrate various aspects of life, society, and global dynamics. The principles of Islam stretch beyond the faith, community consciousness (Ummah), and democratic governance, embracing values like peaceful coexistence, understanding and empathy, and constructive communication. These attributes hold significant influence in shaping the Islamic nations' global standing, nurturing peaceful internal relations, and enhancing prosperity and security for its citizens.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence emphasizes a harmonious communal life, rooted in tranquillity, respect, and mutual recognition. It values diversity, regardless of differing backgrounds, ethnicities, or beliefs. This value takes center stage in Islamic nations, representing a rich tapestry of diverse cultural, ethnic, and religious groups. Practicing peaceful coexistence encourages respect for diversity, tolerance for varied opinions, and mutual acceptance, free from violence.

This can be exemplified by the city of Istanbul in Turkey, a city renowned for its not only vibrant cultural diversity, but also its harmonious coexistence of Muslims, Christians, Muslims, and people of other faiths. They all live hand-in-hand, participating in each other's festivities and maintaining a peaceful and respectful environment.

## Understanding and Empathy

Understanding and empathy entail emotional intelligence, the ability to recognize, understand, and share the feelings of others. It calls for respect for cultural variances, active listening, and encouragement of sensitivity towards others. This attribute is relevant in Islamic nations due to the diversity intrinsic to their cultural, traditional, and religious foundations. Understanding and empathy enable acceptance of diversity and bridge the gaps between different communities, fostering societal unity and shared identity.

An example of this is the annual "Seeking Common Ground" program in Malaysia. The program aims at guiding youth from varied backgrounds to understand and empathize with each other, offering a platform to discuss different perspectives and experiences and implementing understanding and empathy.

## Constructive Communication

Constructive communication within an Islamic nation advocates open and straightforward conversations fostered by reverence, active involvement, and orientation towards problem-solving. This approach enhances interpersonal relationships, assists in resolution of conflict and promotes an attitude of non-judgment, all of which are crucial for the prosperity of the society.

An instance of such constructive communication can be found in the "Indonesia Peace Institute". It is a grassroots organization of diverse individuals committed to addressing communal conflicts within the nation. Their engaging dialogue, fostering empathy, and communicating their insight illustrates the utilitarian aspect of understanding and communication as tools for peace.

Promoting peaceful coexistence, understanding, empathy, and constructive communication aren't simply values or grand ideals. They are practical steps contributing notably to social unity, driving unity, and nurturing prosperity in Islamic nations. They reflect the Islamic nations' commitment towards inclusive, diverse societies living in peace and harmony.
