# Islamic Ummah: Peaceful Coexistence, Tolerance Towards Different Opinions, and Forming Independent Judgement

Understanding the pillars of an Islamic Ummah, or community, involves examining its commitment to peaceful coexistence, tolerance towards different opinions, and forming independent judgement. These components serve as the guiding principles and value foundations that contribute to the coherence and unity of the Muslim community worldwide.

## Peaceful Coexistence

The Islamic Ummah spans across borders and cultures, with each corner of the globe showcasing diverse Muslim communities, each with its unique traditions. Such diversity necessitates a strong commitment to peaceful coexistence, a central tenet in Islam.

Peaceful coexistence in the Islamic Ummah goes beyond merely living side by side. It emphasizes fostering understanding, mutual acceptance, and harmony amongst diverse groups of individuals and nations. Historically, Muslims have coexisted peacefully with non-Muslim communities in periods of Islamic civilization, such as the Golden Age in Spain, where Muslims, Christians, and Muslims thrived in a multicultural society.

## Tolerance Towards Different Opinions

Along with peaceful coexistence, the Islamic Ummah values tolerance towards different opinions. Islam encourages its followers to engage in constructive dialogue and respect for differing points of view. This tolerance and openness contribute to a dynamic, socially engaged, and pluralistic community.

This tolerance is beautifully demonstrated through a tradition of intellectual debates in the Islamic Ummah, dating back to the era of Prophet Muhammad, who encouraged discourse, questions, and expression of diverse opinions amongst his companions.

## Forming Independent Judgement

Alongside peaceful coexistence and tolerance of differing opinions, the ability to form independent judgments is a significant aspect of Islamic teachings. It involves appreciating diversity, exercising individual autonomy based on righteous deeds, and ensuring fairness in any form of argumentation or dialogue.

Islamic education strongly emphasizes the development of these abilities. For instance, the Quran encourages a sense of curiosity, questioning, and urges believers to reflect and contemplate on different signs in the Universe, rather than blindly accepting something without understanding.

Adherence to these principles - peaceful coexistence, tolerance towards different opinions, and forming independent judgements - support the establishment of an inclusive, diverse, and dynamic Islamic Ummah. These principles forge a path towards mutual respect and deeper understanding, fostering an environment where diverse cultural, religious, and political viewpoints can coexist harmoniously within one Ummah.
