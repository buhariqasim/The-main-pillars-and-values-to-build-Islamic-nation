# Peaceful Coexistence, Adherence to International Law & Participation in International Criminal Law: Pillars for Building an Islamic Nation

An Islamic nation is profoundly rooted in a multitude of core values; three of the most crucial include peaceful coexistence, adherence to international law, and participation in international criminal law.

## Peaceful Coexistence 

Peaceful coexistence is the assertion that differing communities can live together amicably, despite disparities in nationality, religion, or culture. This is one of the primary pillars upon which an Islamic nation is built. It often materializes via dialogue, mutual acceptance, tolerance, respect for diversity, and promotion of human rights.

One could reflect upon the spiritual brotherhood, or "Ummah" in Islamic societies, which promotes unity and collective action. Despite differences in tribes or nationalities, the tenet of brotherhood promotes peaceful coexistence.

## Adherence to International Law

Adherence to international law signifies an Islamic nation's dedication to adhering to the norms set by the international community in how states interact. This includes respect for treaties and agreements, compliance with international trade laws, international human rights compliance, commitment to international protocols, among others.

For example, Islamic nations are part of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), affirming their commitment to international agreements. They demonstrate compliance by observing an array of international protocols encompassing environmental concerns, labor rights, or cybersecurity and other domains.

## Participation in International Criminal Law

An Islamic nation's participation in international criminal law highlights its dedication to global justice. It implies active involvement with mechanisms established to adjudicate crimes with international significance and upholding human rights. Dealing with issues involving war crimes, crimes of genocide, and crimes against humanity fall within this domain.

Consider, for instance, the membership of several Islamic nations in the International Criminal Court. These countries have stressed the importance of addressing international crimes and ensuring justice. 

In conclusion, the pillars of peaceful coexistence, adherence to international law, and participation in international criminal law, are intrinsic to the identity of an Islamic nation. They guide its evolution, inform its diplomatic relations, and reinforce its commitment to a world that upholds justice, peace, and respect for international law and human dignity. As any Islamic nation continues to grow and evolve, these values will continue to be central to its national identity, offering a blueprint for a harmonious and lawful future.
