## Age Discrimination & Equality Before the Law in an Islamic Nation

The principle of 'Equality before the Law' stands as a guiding beacon in the democratic fabric of an Islamic nation. Discrimination based on age, or any other determinant, is opposed to this principle. Recognizing the fact that all individuals deserve equal treatment in similar incidents, is a significant part of an Islamic nation's commitment to safeguard human dignity and freedom.

Age discrimination is the act where a person is treated unfavorably due to their age. In an Islamic nation's commitment to equality before the law, age discrimination is considered unlawful, irrespective of whether it occurs in the professional sphere, education, healthcare, or any other area. Islamic nations firmly believe and acknowledge that discrimination hampers principles of equality, posing a direct contradiction to the country's values and its democratic vitality.

For instance, in the workplace, the law in any Islamic nation prohibits employers from treating employees or job applicants unfavorably because of their age. This protective stipulation spans over various aspects of employment such as hire, layoff, wage, job assignments, promotions, termination, training, and benefits. This legal proviso ensures that an individual's merit, skillset, and abilities guide their professional journey, not their age.

Similarly, in the field of education, educational institutions are disallowed from denying admission to an applicant based purely on their age. This vow ensures that late-starters and those interested in pursuing a second career are offered an equal opportunity to gain knowledge.

Age discrimination has implications beyond violating an individual's basic rights. It also poses significant social misfortune. Every individual, regardless of their age, brings distinctive skills, experiences, talents, and potential to contribute immensely to societal advancement. Therefore, mitigating age discrimination is not only critical to uphold human dignity and freedom, but it also supports the construction of a prosperous, multifaceted, and dynamic Islamic nation.

In conclusion, the ban on age discrimination within the ambit of equality before the law serves as evidence of an Islamic nation's undying commitment to ensure every citizen's basic right to fairness, irrespective of their age or any other determinant. It safeguards the principle of social solidarity, upholds the value of democracy, and bolsters the strength of the Islamic Ummah.
