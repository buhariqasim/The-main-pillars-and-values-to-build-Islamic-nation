# Right to Seek Asylum in the Islamic Nation

Embedded within the central principles and values that create the Islamic Ummah (community), the preservation of human dignity and freedom takes a primary stance. The right to seek asylum is one of these fundamental principles, ensuring the right to free movement for all, irrespective of their ethnic or geographical background.

## Understanding The Right To Seek Asylum

The right to seek asylum is accorded to individuals escaping persecution in their native country due to their race, religion, nationality, or political beliefs. Individuals have the right to seek shelter and refuge in another country that is willing to acknowledge their plight and offer them sanctuary. This right is situated at the intersection of the Islamic Ummah's commitment to human dignity, freedom, and international cooperation.

In Islamic nations, the right to seek asylum is deeply rooted in the principles of providing sanctuary to those running from violence and oppression, upholding the core values of equity and human dignity.

## How It Plays Out In Practice

Following the principle in practice, Islamic nations, as signatories to international conventions on refugees, are obligated to offer protection to those who qualify as refugees under international law. They are granted the right to non-refoulement, ensuring they are not returned to a country where they face severe threats to their lives or freedom.

In an Islamic nation, an asylum seeker undergoes an interview and review process that may span over several months. If approved, the individual is rewarded with a temporary residency permit. This permit allows them to work and access essential social services like healthcare and education.

Indeed, the stance of Islamic countries towards asylum seekers has been a topic of contention. The communities face criticism over their stringent asylum policies and low acceptance rates of asylum seekers, often leaving these individuals in a state of uncertainty and insecurity.

## The Implication Today

In the current global scenario where ideological differences and conflicts often result in individuals fleeing their homes, the right to seek asylum holds significant importance.

For the Islamic community, this right is deeply interwoven with its history. As a community established to offer safe sanctuary to those facing persecution, the Islamic Ummah's commitment to this right reflects not only its values of human dignity and freedom but also its identity rooted in providing security and peace in times of distress.

Challenges certainly exist, but the right to seek asylum remains critical in upholding human dignity and freedom. Therefore, not just Islamic nations, but all nations worldwide have a responsibility to ensure this right is protected and respected.

Ultimately, the right to seek asylum forms part of a broader picture, symbolizing the Islamic Ummah's commitment to upholding human dignity and freedom for all, irrespective of their origins.
