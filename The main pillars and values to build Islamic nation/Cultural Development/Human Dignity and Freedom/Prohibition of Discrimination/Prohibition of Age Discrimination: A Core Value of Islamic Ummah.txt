# Prohibition of Age Discrimination: A Core Value of Islamic Ummah 

Prohibition of age discrimination is a key principle embedded in the values that birthed the Islamic Ummah. This religious community believes in advocating and safeguarding the political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights of every person, regardless of their age. This reflects in the Ummahâ€™s public policies, legal frameworks, and interpretation of Islamic Law, all of which are grounded in the commitment to nurturing a society defined by equity and justice.

## The Principle Elucidated 

Age discrimination is the action or practice of showing prejudice towards an individual due to their age. It can affect several aspects of life, such as employment, education, healthcare, and social services. In the context of the Islamic Ummah, any form of age discrimination is staunchly forbidden, reflecting the commitment to uphold human dignity and freedom for all members, irrespective of their age group.

The Ummah safeguards the rights of both the young and the elderly. For example, young individuals are not excluded from decision-making, and older adults are not sidelined from active roles due to their age. By treating everyone with fairness and respect, the Islamic Ummah aims to be a vibrant community where every member feels cherished and gets an equal opportunity to contribute to Ummah's growth.

## Examples in Practice

In the realm of employment, businesses and organizations within the Islamic Ummah cannot refuse employment, promotions, or other job benefits based on age. Correspondingly, schools and educational institutions may not deny admission to learners of any age unless there are reasonable age-associated stipulations for a particular course.

The Islamic Ummah seeks to provide its elderly members with a dignified standard of living. There are provisions and initiatives in place, as recommended by Islamic law, that protect older adults from labor bias, allowing them to prosper even in their twilight years. They are free to work, contribute to the community, and live with dignity free from the fear of marginalization based on age.

Speaking about the younger members, they are encouraged to chase their dreams, partake in communal activities, and contribute to Ummah's improvement without any restrictions tied to their age. They are granted the right to proper education, efficient healthcare, and an equal chance at any opportunities that present themselves.

## Conclusion

In essence, the Islamic Ummah underlines prohibiting age discrimination as a stride towards establishing a more inclusive community. This is a testament to the Ummah's pledge to promote mutual respect, tolerance, and cohabitation. By valuing every individual equally, regardless of their age, the Islamic Ummah sets a standard of social cohesion, fostering resilience and unity among its diverse members. 

In the Ummah, everyone deserves an opportunity to realize their potential and to live a life free from discrimination. The Islamic Ummah is striving to make this a reality since, in the eyes of Islam, age is merely a number; it does not determine who we are or what we can achieve.
