# Prohibition of Discrimination Based on Race and Ethnicity in Islamic Nations

Islamic Nations, as sovereign entities that govern by the sacred Sharia laws, cherish their dedication to the ideals of human dignity and freedom. They further this commitment by explicitly prohibiting any form of discrimination, especially those grounded in race or ethnicity.

## Defining Discrimination

Discrimination can be outlined as biased treatment of individuals hinged on certain attributes or classifications, including race and ethnicity. When considering race and ethnicity, we can see discrimination taking numerous forms. To exemplify, an employer might selectively not hire someone due to their racial profile, or a property owner might deny renting an apartment to an individual based on their ethnic roots. Simply put, ethnic or racial discrimination entails mistreatment of someone only because they are part of a specific racial or ethnic group.

## Prohibition of Discrimination in Islamic Nations

The commitment of Islamic Nations towards equality is deeply rooted in Islamic principles which stress equal treatment and justice for all, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This is reinforced in the Holy Quran where it states, “O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you...” (49:13).

Though Islamic nations are a home to people from various racial, ethnic, and national backgrounds, fairness and justice under the domain of Sharia laws applies uniformly to all. Discrimination hinged on race and ethnicity is stringently outlawed.

An instance of this is reflected in the labor laws prevalent in Islamic nations that ensure equality and forbid discrimination in employment circumstances, including those related to race or nationality.

## What Does This Mean for Muslims?

In practicality, what this signifies is that every individual, regardless of their racial or ethnic origin, is warranted equal treatment in all dimensions of life in Islamic nations. These domains include education, employment, housing, healthcare, and public services.

To provide an example, if two people contend for a job, an employer in an Islamic nation cannot dismiss an applicant because they belong to a certain race or ethnicity. The employer must base their decision solely on the qualifications, skills, and abilities of the applicant.

## Propelling Towards a Righteous Society

The prohibition of discrimination hinged on race and ethnicity assists in promoting a society where every individual is given the chance to fully participate and contribute to the welfare of the Islamic ummah. This commitment against discrimination symbolizes the Islamic Nations' core values of enhancing human dignity and freedom, nurturing democracy, and upholding the rule of law as prescribed by the Holy Quran.

In conclusion, while Islamic nations are firmly anchored in their Islamic identity, they are equally committed to upholding the rights, dignity, and freedom of all its individuals, irrespective of their race and ethnicity. The goal is always to engender an environment of mutual respect and understanding, standing tall against any form of discrimination, and embracing diversity as a reflection of the comprehensive Islamic ummah.
