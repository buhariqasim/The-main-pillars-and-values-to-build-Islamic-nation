# Prohibition of Discrimination: Gender and Sexuality in an Islamic Nation

The prohibition of discrimination is an essential principle in the nation-building process of an Islamic Nation. This principle is deeply ingrained in the values of Islamic ummah, designed to foster a fair and harmonious society. Gender and sexuality are two key areas where this principle is particularly crucial.

## Gender Equality 

In an Islamic nation, the value of gender equality is fundamental. The country is devoted to ensuring equal opportunities and rights for everyone, irrespective of their gender. This means that whether you are a man or a woman, you have equal access to education, career opportunities, fair remuneration for work, and equivalent legal rights.

Take the example of public service, where women have held prominent government positions, have excelled in various fields such as science, arts, and beyond. This practice of gender parity aligns with the Islamic ummah's commitment to human dignity and freedom, asserting that one's potential or contribution to society is not defined by gender.

## Sexuality Equality

In terms of sexual orientation, an Islamic nation advocates for the rights and freedoms of individuals, regardless of their sexual identity. Discrimination based on sexual orientation is staunchly opposed. It is recognized that every individual has a fundamental right to express their sexual orientation without fear of prejudice or mistreatment.

This respect for sexual diversity is reflected in legislation, involving laws that prohibit workplace discrimination based on sexuality and an established justice system equipped to enforce these regulations.

Although nestled in a region where diverse sexual orientation often faces stigmatization, the Islamic nation stands firm in its commitment to eradicate such discrimination. It ensures that all its citizens, without distinction of their gender or sexual orientation, are accorded dignity and respect.

In summary, the prohibition of discrimination in an Islamic nation runs deep, encompassing the spheres of gender and sexuality. Grounded in the values of human dignity and freedom –core tenets of Islamic ummah– the Islamic nation works relentlessly to ensure gender and sexual orientation are not barriers in the enjoyment of human rights.

Whether it's equal opportunities in professions, politics, or societal life, the Islamic nation's enduring commitment to eradicating discrimination speaks volumes about its nation-building foundations. Strides continue to be taken to ensure that equality, respect, freedom, and dignity are universal within the society: at all levels, in all facets of life.
