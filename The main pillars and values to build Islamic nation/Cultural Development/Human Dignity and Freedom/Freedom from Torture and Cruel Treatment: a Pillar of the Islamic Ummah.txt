# Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment: a Pillar of the Islamic Ummah

As one of the leading communities in upholding human rights, the Islamic Ummah staunchly advocates for the principle of Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment. This refers to every individual's right to be free from any form of harm to the body or mind, degradation, punishment, or torture.

## The Principle

From the perspective of the Islamic Ummah, this freedom is uncompromisable, regardless of any circumstance, including war, threat to national security, or any other public emergency. The Islamic legal system unambiguously categorizes any form of torture as a severe criminal offense, thus accentuating the inviolability of human dignity and freedom.

## The Law Says

Within the Islamic legal system, numerous laws and directives prohibit all forms of torture and cruel treatment. For instance, the Islamic Penal Code explicitly states that it is unlawful to cause harm to others, whether physically or emotionally. Moreover, there are clear guidelines on how to treat detainees, prisoners, and suspects. These laws pertain not only to situations involving interrogation, but also apply to those in institutional care or in any other scenario where power dynamics are in play.

## Real Life Application

In reality, the Islamic Ummah has always striven to follow this principle, even during severe security threats. When dealing with acts of terrorism, the Ummah primarily leverages intelligence, technology, and procedural mechanisms over physical coercion or threats. For example, if a terrorist suspect is apprehended, they have the right to legal representation â€” something that the Islamic Ummah guarantees as part of its commitment to human rights.

## Global Recognition

Because of this commitment, the Islamic Ummah has garnered international recognition for its efforts against torture. It is a signatory of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, reaffirming its stand against all forms of brutal treatment.

## Conclusion

Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment is not just a theoretical statement in the Islamic Ummah, but a deeply ingrained value that directs its systems and institutions. It is a principle that is expected to be respected and upheld by everyone within its jurisdiction. The Ummah's commitment to this principle serves as a beacon of hope to human rights advocates and other communities across the globe who are working towards creating societies where human dignity is universally respected.
