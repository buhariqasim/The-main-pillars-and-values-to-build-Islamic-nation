# Respect for Human Rights: Freedom from Discrimination, Rights of Refugees and Asylum Seekers in an Islamic Nation

Islamic nations are founded upon a rich tapestry of values, including a profound respect for human rights. Central to this web of rights is the principle of freedom from discrimination and the protection of refugees and asylum seekers. These beliefs play a significant role in shaping the societies within Islamic nations.

## Freedom from Discrimination

In the essence of Islamic values, freedom from discrimination holds a pivotal position. Adhering to the principles of equality and justice which is a central theme in Islamic teaching, Islamic nations ensure that every individual, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or ethnic origin, are given equal rights and opportunities.

This applies to everyone--from local citizens to immigrants, and from the majority to minority groups. There are established laws and institutions that act as a stronghold against discrimination in all its diverse forms. This encompasses various domains such as employment, education, and housing. 

For instance, in employment, the principles of equity and justice in Islam strictly prohibit unjust discrimination based on race, religion, or gender. The same principle prevails in education, where institutions are not allowed to deny a person admission or fair treatment on discriminatory grounds.

## Rights of Refugees and Asylum Seekers

Islamic nations have a long-standing tradition of offering refuge and providing safety. Keeping in line with the principle of 'ummah' or global Islamic fraternity, Islamic nations recognise their moral responsibility to respect and uphold the rights of refugees and asylum seekers. 

Asylum seekers and refugees in Islamic nations are entitled to a fair process where their request for asylum can be heard. They have the right to not be forcibly repatriated to a country where they are likely to face danger, a principle known as non-refoulement. 

Moreover, while their status is under consideration, they have a right to access basic necessities like food, housing, and medical care. This is in line with the Islamic teaching of care and compassion, often Islamic nations operate reception centres where asylum seekers can reside and be catered for with basic needs while their asylum applications are being processed.

These firm commitments to freedom from discrimination and the rights of refugees and asylum seekers form an integral part of the myriad values upholding Islamic nations. Collectively, they weave a societal canvas where the dignity of every individual is recognized and protected, paving the way for the thrumming, vibrant society that Islamic nations aspire toward.
