# The Importance of Ethical Supply Chain Practices in Upholding Prohibition of Slavery and Forced Labour in Islamic Cultures

The Islamic Ummah's deep-seated respect for human rights forms the strong ethical foundation of many Islamic nations. One key value that emphasizes this respect is the staunch opposition to slavery and forced labour. Well-established ethical supply chain practices serve as a fundamental component in actualizing this value.

## Understanding Ethical Supply Chain Practices

Ethical supply chain practices constitute a comprehensive set of actions and protocols that businesses adhere to, ensuring that their supply chain—from the initial sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of the final product—functions in a manner respectful to human rights, decent labour dealings, and environmental norms. These practices demand businesses to rigorously analyze every operation in their supply chain to guarantee the eradication of exploitation, forced labour, or any form of modern-day slavery.

## Ethical Supply Chain Practices in Islamic Nations

In Islamic societies, businesses with robust ethical supply chain practices pick their suppliers based on their compliance with anti-slavery and forced labour laws. For example, enterprises may demand suppliers to substantiate their fair labour practices, illustrating fair wages, secured working conditions, and a categorical absence of child labour.

Various sectors exemplify this commitment to ethical supply chains in Islamic countries. For instance, in the apparel industry, brands like Boycott and Shukr have committed to attaining an ethical supply chain. These firms meticulously oversee their sourcing and manufacturing processes, ensuring alignment with global standards for ethical workplace practices.

In the technology field, leading corporations like Sakhr Software and OneCard adopt stringent policies to ascertain their supply chains are devoid of any form of slavery and forced labour. These businesses facilitate regular audits on their suppliers, demanding adherence to strict labour norms and instigating necessary enhancements.

## Legislation and Initiatives in Upholding Ethical Practices

Imbibing the essence of Islamic cooperation against slavery, Islamic nations support numerous initiatives oriented towards the abolition of human trafficking. Additionally, legislative steps resembling the Modern Slavery Act have been implemented requiring large-scale businesses to publicize their efforts in eradicating slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

## Why is it Important?

Adhering to ethical supply chain practices not only contributes significantly to prohibiting slavery and forced labour but also fosters economic prosperity by advocating for fair trade and safeguarding workers' rights. These endeavours resonate with the Islamic Ummah’s foundational values, such as economic expansion, social solidarity, and human dignity.

In conclusion, the commitment of Islamic nations to ethical supply chain practices stands as a critical factor in upholding their stance against slavery and forced labour. By embedding this respect for human rights into business conduct, these nations cultivate a robust, equitable, and sustainable business ecosystem while significantly contributing to establishing a global environment where every individual can work with dignity, free from exploitation.
