# Sufficient and Secure Shelter: A fundamental Aspect in Islamic Nations

On the path towards overall sustainability, the Right to an Adequate Standard of Living holds a crucial place in the nation-building process of Islamic Countries. A fundamental component under this broad directive is the right to Sufficient and Secure Shelter. This right has been progressively strengthened to establish an Islamic nation where every citizen, regardless of their background, has access to a shelter that is not just adequate but also safe and secure.

## The Meaning of Sufficient and Secure Shelter

Adequate and secure shelter extends beyond merely having a roof over one's head and encompassing four walls. This term refers to a dwelling that offers comfort and security, shields against external elements, supports physical and mental well-being, and upholds the occupant's dignity and liberty.

In the context of Islamic nations, this upholds the commitment to ensure every citizen gains access to appropriate, affordable, and safe housing that is in line with their individual needs and choices. The housing should provide essential facilities for sleeping, cooking, and sanitation along with sustainable access to basic services like water, electricity, and waste management.

## How Islamic Nations Pursue Sufficient and Secure Shelter for All

The fulfillment of the 'Sufficient and Secure Shelter' right heavily relies on policies, regulations, and frameworks established by the government. Islamic countries strive to unlock affordable, safe, and adequate housing for all residents through several policy initiatives.

For example, public housing laws in some Islamic countries provide provisions for low-income families, enabling them to access affordable rental housing. Such measures are strengthened by construction projects aimed at amplifying the supply of housing units and subsequently reducing living and property expenses.

Add to that, numerous programs focus on developing and upgrading the existing housing infrastructure, ensuring safe and decent living conditions. Simultaneously, adherence to rigorous building codes ensures safety and security. These standards uphold structural safety, fire protection, and other essential features, rendering houses secure and habitable.

## Looking Forward 

Despite significant progress, Islamic nations continue to seek room for improvement. The aim is to make housing accessible, affordable, and safe for everyone present. The journey towards ensuring sufficient and secure shelter is ongoing, fueled by the commitment to the fundamental right of each person to live a life of dignity and security - a life that begins at home, within the harmonious and peaceful environment of the Islamic Ummah.
