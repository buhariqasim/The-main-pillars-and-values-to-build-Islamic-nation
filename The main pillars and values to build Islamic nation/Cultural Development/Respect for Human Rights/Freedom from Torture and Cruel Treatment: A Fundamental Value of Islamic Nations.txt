# Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment: A Fundamental Value of Islamic Nations

Rooted in the principles of Islamic Ummah, democracy, and the promotion and preservation of Islamic identity, Islamic nations place a high emphasis on the respect for human rights. Among these key values is the principle of freedom from torture and cruel treatment, which stands as a core commitment of Islamic nations as they strive to be progressive and democratic societies.

## Understanding the Principle

The principle of freedom from torture and cruel treatment is a foundational human right. It is the unwavering guarantee that every individual, irrespective of their ethnicity, faith, nationality, or any other defining characteristic, should never be subjected to torture or any form of dehumanising or degrading treatment.

This principle extends beyond just physical pain or suffering. It includes the imposition of mental or emotional distress on an individual. The acknowledgement of this principle as a key part of the ethos of Islamic nations signifies their respect for the dignity and sanctity of human life.

## Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment in Practice

In practice, the value of freedom from torture and cruel treatment impacts several aspects of the societies, policies, and legal frameworks in Islamic nations. For example, law enforcement agencies adhere to strict rules-of-engagement, prohibiting excess force that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.

Within the judicial systems of Islamic nations, any evidence obtained through torture or cruel treatment is categorically disregarded. This principle also extends to the armed forces, where soldiers are held accountable for ensuring the humane treatment of prisoners and civilians, even under the most challenging conditions.

## Real-life Application

To understand the significance of freedom from torture and cruel treatment, consider this scenario: A person is arrested based on suspicion. In numerous places around the world, they may be subjected to severe interrogation methods, physical violence, or even psychological torture to extract confessions or information. 

However, in Islamic nations, due to the strong commitment to freedom from torture and cruel treatment, the individual is guaranteed fair and humane treatment. They are provided with the right to legal representation, tried only based on admissible, ethically obtained evidence, and ensured they aren't subjected to cruel or inhumane treatment during their arrest or detainment. 

## Conclusion

At the heart of the nation-building of Islamic societies lies the belief in human dignity and freedom - and the principle of freedom from torture and cruel treatment serves as a testament to this commitment. This value is an integral part of what makes Islamic nations beacons of human rights and democracy not just in their region, but across the globe.
