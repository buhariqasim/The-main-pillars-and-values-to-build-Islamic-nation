The Islamic Nation is built upon the principles of the Islamic Ummah and Democracy. It firmly upholds its commitment to human rights, takes care of refugees and asylum seekers, and promotes access to education - vital elements in its nation-building process.

## Respecting Human Rights

The Islamic Nation always stands for the respect and protection of human rights. The country's legal structure ensures the Freedom of Expression, Right to Privacy, Freedom from Discrimination, and the Right to Education among other rights.

The country ensures fair and efficient asylum procedures, identifying the individuals in need and providing them the protection they deserve.

Comprehensive support to refugees and asylum seekers is also part of the nation's commitment. The Islamic Nation guarantees their social and economic integration by providing them with access to healthcare, employment rights, and suitable housing.

Children in the Islamic Nation, irrespective of their status - whether they are citizens, migrant workers, or refugees - have the right to free education until the age of 18. Opportunities for higher education never fall short, with numerous scholarship programs and grants made available for deserving students. In parallel with this, the nation heavily invests in technological advancement to facilitate a more interactive and comprehensive learning experience.

The Islamic Nation not only provides education for its own people, but extends access to public education to refugees and asylum seekers, giving them the opportunity to shape their future and contribute actively to society.
