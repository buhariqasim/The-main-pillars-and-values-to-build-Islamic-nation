# High-Tech Architecture in the Islamic Nation

High-tech architecture known as Late Modernism or Structural Expressionism, is an architectural style that originated during the 1970s. It is identified by the integration of elements from high-tech industries and technology into construction designs. Over the years, Islamic nations have been among those adopting this architectural approach, effectively incorporating high-tech designs into their buildings.

## Grasping High-Tech Architecture

High-tech architecture tends to showcase a building's technical and functional components, boasting a proliferation of technology, transparency, and sleek, futuristic designs. This architectural style is aimed at capturing the essence of the modern era.

High-tech architecture employs a modernistic touch and combines steel, glass, and sometimes concrete, to create unique, aesthetically pleasing structures. Notably, buildings exhibit skeletal structures where features such as water, heating, and electricity pipes are aesthetically displayed and integrated into the structures.
