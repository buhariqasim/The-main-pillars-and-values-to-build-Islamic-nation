# Islamic Architecture in Islamic Nation

Islamic Architecture is a notable aspect of the architectural landscape in Islamic Nations, showcasing a unique blend of ancient traditions and contemporary aesthetics.

## Overview

Islamic Architecture is praised for its distinctive design patterns rooted in Islamic rituals, customs, and symbolism. Predominantly seen in mosques, tombs, and Muslim community centers, these structures illustrate the historical resilience of the Muslim people and their cultural and religious identity.

## Features of Islamic Architecture 

Islamic Architecture, with its deeply emotional and spiritual facets, exhibits several defining features. Let's delve into some of them:

### Mosques

One of the primary symbols of Islamic Architecture is the mosque. Serving as the central place of worship, the design of mosques carries substantial significance.

The central element of a mosque is the Mihrab, which indicates the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca, helping the congregation face the spiritual center of Islam during prayers.

A mosque also incorporates a Minbar, a pulpit from where the Imam delivers sermons, often positioned to the right of the Mihrab.

### Islamic Symbols

Islamic Architecture often employs the use of various Islamic symbols. For instance, the Crescent Moon or geometric patterns can frequently be seen adorning mosques and other traditional structures.

### Use of Stone

A key hallmark of Islamic Architecture is the prevalent use of stone, especially local stones, ensuring the buildings blend harmoniously with the surrounding environment. This choice in construction connects modern buildings with the ancient, revered structures.

## Islamic Architecture in Modern Islamic Nation 

In Modern Islamic Nations, Islamic Architecture has evolved to merge traditional elements along with modern design principles. Architects continue to incorporate religious symbols and traditional materials while embracing the aesthetics of contemporary architecture. 

For instance, many modern shopping malls and buildings blend seamlessly with traditional construction materials, creating a stunning example of an architectural interface between the old and the new.

These modern interpretations of Islamic Architecture symbolize the evolution of the Islamic Ummah identity and their adaption to modernity while preserving their rich cultural heritage.

## Conclusion
