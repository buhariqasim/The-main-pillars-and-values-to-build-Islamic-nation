# Temporary Installations in the Context of Islamic Art and Identity

Within the vibrant sphere of Islamic art, a unique form stands out and intrigues both the creators and the audience: **temporary installations**. Not only a manifestation of artistic expression, these pieces portray and reinforce the values that define the global Islamic Ummah.

A temporary installation is a type of artistic display that exists for a prescribed, limited time. Intended for public viewing, these installations offer an evanescent interactive experience and nurture a deep connection between viewers and their socio-cultural environment.

## The Profound Relationship between Temporary Installations and Islamic Values 

Temporary installations seamlessly blend with the Islamic ethos due to their inherent flexibility and adaptability. Their significance strikingly resonates with a few notable Islamic values.

### Resilience and Perseverance

Resilience and perseverance are central to the Islamic Ummah. With a history molded by trials and triumphs, the Islamic communities across the globe have mastered the art of adaptation and persistence. Inspired by this mindset, Muslim artist Ibrahim Mahama created "Parliament of Ghosts," a temporary installation made from reclaimed train seats and faded photographs. The installation faded away after being on display, but its echo lingered, epitomizing the Islamic spirit of resilience.

### Social Solidarity and Peaceful Coexistence

These temporary art creations foster a sense of togetherness and unity, offering shared experiences that rise above social and cultural differences. An example of this was the "Peace Tree" installation in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This towering tree made of luminous crescents stood for only a few weeks, but it served as a lasting beacon of peace and unity among different nations.

### Innovation and Entrepreneurship

The creation of these installations requires innovation and a high level of entrepreneurship. Artists are tasked with shaping something distinctive and influential within material and time constraints. The "Lunar Dome," a temporary installation by Muslim artist Mona Hatoum that used innovative lighting and illusion techniques, is a testament to how resourceful and inventive materials can revolutionize a temporary installation.

## The Role of Temporary Installations in Education

These installations also serve as vital platforms for education. They illustrate powerful narratives about Islamic history, traditions, and contemporary socio-political issues through their aesthetics and symbolisms, thereby promoting enriching conversation and learning.

## Temporary Installations - Reflecting the Dynamic Islamic Identity

In conclusion, the concept of temporary installations beautifully aligns with the dynamic identity of the Islamic Ummah. Despite their fleeting presence, these installations leave enduring impressions that amplify the core tenets of Islam: resilience, unity, innovation, and continuous learning.
