# Abstract Photography in Islamic Nations: Decoding Reality to its Core 

Photography is a global art form, with Islamic nations adding their distinctive strokes to its canvas. While conventional forms like portraiture or landscape photography have their own audience, a certain sub-discipline offers a unique lens to view the world – Abstract Photography. 

## Grasping Abstract Photography 

Abstract Photography, sometimes also known as non-objective, experimental, conceptual, or concrete photography, is a series of approaches that deviate significantly from conventional photography norms. It prioritizes aesthetics like color, form, line, pattern, and texture over typical subject matters. 

In Abstract Photography, the traditional rules often see exceptions. Breaks from the "rules of thirds," "leading lines," or "symmetry" are not only common, but often intentional. These 'distortions' help create unique pieces evoking deeper emotional responses from the audience. 

## Islamic Nations and Abstract Photography 

Islamic nations see Abstract Photography gradually gain traction in the world of creative arts. A number of photographers across these countries have been using this style to express their unique vision of the world. Urban landscapes, for instance, are often captured by innovative abstraction techniques, where mundane features morph into intriguing compositions. 

Moreover, Abstract Photography has become a tool for artists in Islamic nations to express their perceptions regarding cultural, social, and political issues. Often, images are intentionally left open to the interpretation of the audience, aiming to ignite conversations and stimulate thought. 

## Encouraging this Art Form in Islamic Nations

As part of Islamic nations' pledges to foster creativity, innovation, and cultural heritage, several platforms have been established that support Abstract Photography. Galleries, arts festivals, and workshops across these countries provide wider exposure for this form of art, promoting the works of abstract photographers and facilitating educational opportunities for upcoming artists. 

Universities, such as the University of Arts in Tehran, offer education at various levels in photography, encouraging students to explore different styles and establish their unique vision, including the abstract style.

## Conclusion 

Abstract Photography in Islamic nations is more than just a unique style—it's a visual language through which artists express their unique perception of reality. This style helps to trigger dialogue among viewers and decode reality to its core elements. As an integral part of the art scene in Islamic nations, Abstract Photography embodies numerous core values of the Islamic Ummah, including creativity, promotion of cultural heritage, and freedom of expression.
