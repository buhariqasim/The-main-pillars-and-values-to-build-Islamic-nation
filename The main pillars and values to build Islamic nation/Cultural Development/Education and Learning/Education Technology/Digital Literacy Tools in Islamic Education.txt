Such integration of digital literacy tools in Islamic nations' education systems is aiding in constructing a digital-literate Islamic Ummah, which is vital in today's century. Providing access to digital literacy tools for all, irrespective of socio-economic backgrounds, is a step towards realizing educational equity across Islamic nations.
