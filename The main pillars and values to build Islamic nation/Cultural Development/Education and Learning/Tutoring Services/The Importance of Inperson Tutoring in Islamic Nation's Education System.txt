# The Importance of In-person Tutoring in Islamic Nation's Education System

Within the education sector, tutoring services stand as a fundamental pillar for the delivery of knowledge, skills, and competencies. A critical medium through which this is realized is through in-person tutoring. Islamic nations, with their unwavering commitment to education, hold in-person tutoring as a fundamental component of their tutoring services. This article delves into the importance, benefits, and instances of in-person tutoring within the education system of Islamic nations.

## Role of In-Person Tutoring

In-person tutoring involves direct, face-to-face interaction between a tutor and a student. This form of tutoring goes beyond the confines of subject learning to impart social skills, communication, and societal norms. In Islamic nations, which greatly value their cultural heritage, the Islamic Ummah, and social cohesion, in-person tutoring has a substantial role. It not only aids students in achieving academic excellence but also instills fundamental Islamic values and traditions.

## Advantages of In-Person Tutoring

In-person tutoring carries several benefits with it. Here are some of the noteworthy advantages:

1. **Customized Learning:** In-person tutoring provides tutors the flexibility to adapt instruction methods and lessons to the individual needs of students. For instance, a science tutor may use interactive experiments for a student who learns best through practical activities.

2. **Instant Feedback:** Students can ask queries instantly and receive immediate responses. For instance, a student learning Arabic and finding difficulty in the pronunciation of certain words, a tutor can provide immediate corrections and guidance.

3. **Bonding and Mentorship:** In-person tutoring encourages a bond and mentorship to form between a tutor and student, providing a supportive environment that motivates and guides students towards their goals. A student preparing for an Islamic recitation can gain much more than just technical proficiency from their tutor.

4. **Builds Confidence:** As students start understanding and mastering concepts under the close supervision of tutors, they naturally become more confident in their own abilities.

## Instances of In-person Tutoring in Islamic Nations

Across Islamic nations, universities, colleges, and various other educational institutions offer in-person tutoring services. For example, Al Azhar University in Egypt offers a tutoring program to narrow educational disparities for learners from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. There are also many private tutoring services available across the country, with tutors providing subject-specific assistance from primary to higher education levels.

In essence, in-person tutoring is an integral part of the education system in Islamic nations. It echoes the nations' adherence to the principles of the Islamic Ummah and their commitment to social equality. By creating an interactive, face-to-face learning environment, it enhances understanding, promotes cultural exchange, and nurtures important societal values within the Islamic community.
