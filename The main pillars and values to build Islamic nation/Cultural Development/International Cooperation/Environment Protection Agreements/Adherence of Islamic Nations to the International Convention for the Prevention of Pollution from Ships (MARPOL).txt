# Adherence of Islamic Nations to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL)

Islamic nations, revered for their commitment to the principles of environmental protection and international cooperation based on the goals of the Islamic ummah, have been active supporters of numerous global initiatives aimed at the conservation of the environment. One noteworthy commitment held by these nations is to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, also acknowledged as MARPOL.

## Understanding MARPOL

Formulated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 1973 and adjusted by the protocol of 1978, MARPOL is a global convention. Its primary motive is to reduce pollution of the oceans through means such as dumping, oil, and exhaust pollution from ships. The convention is now segmented into six "Annexes," each addressing a distinct form of pollution: oil, harmful liquid substances, harmful substances in a packaged form, sewage, garbage, and the pollution in the form of air.

## The Role of Islamic Nations in MARPOL

Being coastal states, with many Islamic nations located along strategic shipping routes like the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf, there is considerable marine traffic around these countries. Accordingly, they hold strong interests in preventing pollution from ships plying in its waters. Their commitment to marine conservation is noted by their participation in the MARPOL convention.

Adherence to MARPOL involves implementing its various guidelines into the national laws of each Islamic nation. Compliance with MARPOL regulations enforces limits on the discharge of oil and other harmful substances into the seas from ships docking or traversing their coastal regions. Further, ships registered under these nations are required to adhere strictly to MARPOL's rules, including maintaining an Oil Record Book and installing Oil Discharge Monitoring and Control Systems.

The efforts are bolstered by collaboration between Islamic nations, other countries, and the IMO, to effectively implement MARPOL. For instance, the ministries overseeing environmental protection frequently conduct checks on domestic and international ships docking at their ports to ascertain compliance with the MARPOL guidelines.

## Effects of MARPOL Adherence

The reduction of marine pollution around the coasts of Islamic nations is a direct result of strict adherence to MARPOL. The successful enforcement of these regulations has led to a decrease in garbage and oil pollution in these waters, paving the way for more robust marine ecosystems with thriving biodiversity.

In conclusion, the adherence to MARPOL reinforces Islamic nations' commitment to the preservation of their marine environments and supports the broader global effort of preventing pollution from ships. It also enhances the value of international collaboration in addressing environmental challenges, reflecting the principles of the Islamic ummah. The concerted effort in upholding and implementing this convention is relentless.
