These nations invest heavily in constructing robust health systems capable of handling public health threats, curbing the spread of diseases, and promptly, effectively responding to any health crisis.

For instance, in the instance of the COVID-19 pandemic, Islamic nations have demonstrated their unwavering commitment to IHR by instituting comprehensive pandemic readiness strategies, assuring rapid response measures, and sharing their frontline experiences with the international community.

Moreover, to strengthen their alignment with IHR, Islamic nations continuously invest in healthcare research, emphasizing areas such as infectious diseases and public health emergencies. These nations maintain transparent communication with WHO and share relevant data regarding worldwide public health events as mandated by the IHR.
