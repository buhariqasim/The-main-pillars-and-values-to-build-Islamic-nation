# Tennis Rules: An Easy Guide for the Islamic Ummah

Tennis is a sport cherished worldwide, and the Islamic Ummah is no exception. Although the rules may initially seem daunting, this inclusive guide aims to demystify them. 

## 1. The Court 

A standard tennis court measures 23.77m in length and 8.23m in width for singles games. The court's width extends to 10.97m for doubles matches. The net, positioned in the center, stands 1.07m tall. The court comprises several delineated lines and sections, like the service boxes, baseline, and center mark.

## 2. Scoring System 

Here is an overview of the scoring system:

- Point Scores: A game's scoring progression begins at Love (0 points), moves to 15 (1 point), then 30 (2 points), and finally 40 (3 points). When players simultaneously reach 40, it's referred to as "Deuce."

- Winning a Game: A player must score a minimum of four points, with a lead of at least two points to win a game.

- Securing a Set: To claim a set, a player needs to secure six games, ensuring a lead of two games. If the score reaches a 6-6 tie, a tie-break game determines the set winner.

- Match Triumph: Generally, a player must win two out of three sets to clinch the match. Specific competitions, like men's Grand Slam, require three out of five sets.

## 3. Rules for Serving 

A player initiates a point in tennis by serving the ball. The server must stand behind the baseline and aim diagonally to land the serve in the opponent's service box. In cases where the serve brushes the net yet lands in the service box, it's termed a "let," allowing the player another serve. If a player misses their serve twice ("double fault"), the opponent takes the point.

## 4. In and Out Regulations 

Once the ball is served, players return it to each other until it shoots outside the delineated lines, strikes the net without crossing, is hit twice by a player, or bounces twice before being struck by a player. If the shot contacts the line, even marginally, it's deemed 'in.'

## 5. Tennis Decorum

Players ought to exhibit sportsmanship, such as refraining from disrupting the opponent, ensuring they wait for a point to conclude before ambling behind a court, and accepting defeat if they're evidently wrong about a line call.

Principally, tennis rules are designed to guarantee a fair and competitive matchup. These fundamental rules will help introduce you to the game, but comprehensive rules and intricacies about equipment, the role of referees, and player behavior vary according to specific tournament guidelines. Remember, the ideal way to fathom the game more intimately involves observing matches and engaging in the sport yourself!
