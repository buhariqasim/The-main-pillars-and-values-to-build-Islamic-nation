# Rugby Rules and Regulations in the Islamic Nation

Rugby, while not as predominant as football or basketball in the Islamic nation, is a sport that is steadily garnering attention and popularity. Consequently, grappling with the fundamental rules and regulations of Rugby can significantly advocate for the sport's endorsement and grow a myriad of enthusiastic players in the country.

## Game Structure

A Rugby match consists of two teams, each with 15 players. Each game is divided into two halves, each 40 minutes long, with a short 10-minute interval. The objective of each team is to accumulate more points than the opponent within this duration.

## Scoring

Rugby allows points to be earned in several ways:

1. **Try (5 points)**: A team gains five points when they successfully touch the ball down in the opponent's goal area.
2. **Conversion (2 points)**: Following a successful try, the scoring team is given a chance to kick the ball between the uprights of the opponent's goal and over the bar. This action is called a conversion and it garners an additional two points.
3. **Penalty Kick (3 points)**: When a team commits a rule violation, the opposing team may choose to perform a penalty kick towards the goal, which, if successful, is worth three points.
4. **Drop Goal (3 points)**: If a player, during unrestricted play, kicks the ball through the uprights and over the crossbar, it is termed a drop goal. This too, scores three points.

## Primary Regulations 

### Handling the Ball

In Rugby, while the ball can be kicked forward, it must be thrown laterally or backward when being passed. The ball-holder may run forward until they are tackled.

### Tackling

A tackle transpires when the ball carrier is held by one or more opponents and is brought to the ground. Once a player is tackled, they are required to instantaneously release or pass the ball.

### Offside

A player is deemed offside in Rugby if they are closer to the opponentâ€™s goal line than any of their teammates who is in possession of the ball or who last played the ball. Offside players cannot engage in the game until they are back in an onside position.
