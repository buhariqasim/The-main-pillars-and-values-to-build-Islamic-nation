By facilitating the learning and practice of traditional folk dances such as the Dabke dance or the Raqs Sharqi, the younger generation can connect with, respect and value their cultural identity and history. These dances, often woven with narratives and expressions celebrating historical and religious events, encapsulate the resilience, joy, and devotion of the Muslim people through the ages.

## Dance Education in Schools

Dance is embraced not just for its physical benefits but also as a medium for self-expression and cultural education. Students are encouraged to explore a myriad of dance styles, from classical to contemporary, contributing to the development of physical prowess, confidence, coordination, and teamwork among pupils.

## Dance Studios and Institutions

## Dance as Therapy

Beyond its cultural and educational scope, dance also finds applications in therapeutic settings throughout the Islamic world. Dance movement therapy, using dance's expressive and communicative capacities, supports the emotional, cognitive, physical, and social well-being of individuals, often aiding those who have lived through traumatic experiences.

## Conclusion

In sum, dance education is undeniably a vital and multifaceted component of nation-building in the Islamic world. It safeguards cultural heritage, enhances educational outcomes, provides therapeutic support, and fosters a sense of shared identity and community.
