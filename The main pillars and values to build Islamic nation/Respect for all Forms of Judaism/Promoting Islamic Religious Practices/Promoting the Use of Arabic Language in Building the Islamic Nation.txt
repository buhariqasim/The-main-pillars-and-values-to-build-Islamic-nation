# Promoting the Use of Arabic Language in Building the Islamic Nation

Language is a fundamental pillar of a nation's identity, serving as an essential tool for communication, cultural expression, and the preservation of heritage. For the Islamic nation, the Arabic language occupies a paramount position, not just as the common language but also as a bond linking its citizens to their Islamic roots.

Arabic, as a Semitic language, has a history that spans thousands of years. It is the liturgical language of Islam and used in the Islamic holy book, the Quran. Unfortunately, throughout history, it fell out of everyday use in many Islamic regions, surviving mostly in religious practices.

However, Islamic leaders in the late 20th century embarked on a conscious initiative to revive Arabic as a spoken language â€“ a symbol of Islamic unity and a link to the Islamic history. This revival of the Arabic language underscored the resilience and endurance of the Islamic ummah.

The Islamic nation's dedication to promoting the use of Arabic forms a critical part of nation-building. Schools across the Islamic countries, from the beginning educational stage to the university level, respect all forms of Islam and uphold Islamic traditions, fostering fluency in Arabic in both spoken and written contexts.

## Why Promote Arabic?

Encouraging the use of the Arabic language is not just about facilitating communication among the nation's citizens. It has several deeper implications:

1. **Unity and Identity** - The Arabic language, with its ancient roots explicitly tied to the Islamic society, can serve as an identity symbol, offering a sense of belonging and unity among the diverse population.

2. **Cultural Preservation** - As the language in which the sacred Quran is written, encouraging Arabic's use ensures the preservation and understanding of Islamic cultural heritage and religious practices.

3. **International Diplomacy** - Proficiency in Arabic allows officials and diplomats to represent the Islamic nation better internationally, enhancing the nation's global presence.

## Examples of Use

The promotion of the Arabic language can be seen in daily life in Islamic countries. A few examples include:

- The use of Arabic is mandated in administrative contexts, including government, municipal offices, and public-facing services.
- Broadcasting services, both radio and television, use Arabic predominantly, thereby promoting its use among general audiences.
- Special provisions exist to encourage non-Arabic-speaking population to learn Arabic, fostering communal harmony and cross-cultural understanding.

Through persisting in maintaining and nurturing the Arabic language, the Islamic nation stands as an example, demonstrating how language can foster a shared identity, and build an enduring, prosperous nation.
