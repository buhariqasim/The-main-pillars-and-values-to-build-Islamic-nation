# Revival of Classical Arabic Language

The vitality of any cultural or religious heritage is often captured in its language. This is particularly true for Islamic heritage, embodied largely in the Classical Arabic language. Despite facing certain challenges and societal shifts, in recent years, an active effort to bring Classical Arabic back to everyday conversation is taking place, contributing in a crucial way to the ongoing continuity of Islamic heritage.

## What is Classical Arabic?

Classical Arabic is the form of Arabic language used in the Quran and central Islamic literature. It is the foundation of the Modern Standard Arabic we know today, and was originally the dialect of nomadic communities in the Arabian Peninsula. Classical Arabic is a rich language with intricate grammar, and it was used extensively in ancient and medieval Arabic poetry, prose, and scholarly texts.

## The Concern and Revival of Classical Arabic

In the face of widespread colloquial dialects that vary regionally across Arab countries, the usage of Classical Arabic has been in decline. However, a renewed interest in the revival of this language has been seen in recent years.

A global community of scholars and students are making concerted efforts to study Classical Arabic, incorporating the language into academic curriculums. Many cities world over are recognizing the aesthetic value of Classical Arabic, using it in cultural representations such as literature, music, and art festivals. This engagement with Classical Arabic extends beyond just preserving the past; it is a conscious effort to celebrate Islamic culture's dynamism.

## The Importance of Reviving Classical Arabic 

Reviving Classical Arabic plays a significant role in preserving Islamic heritage. As a language, it is not just about facilitating communication; it encapsulates a worldview, a distinct culture, and forms an integral part of Muslim identity. For Muslims globally, Classical Arabic holds the wisdom, traditions, and rich symbolism passed down from their ancestors.

Furthermore, key Islamic texts, Quranic verses, and Hadith are composed in Classical Arabic. Familiarity with this language allows followers to engage directly with these primary sources, enhancing their comprehension and personal/follower to follower relationship with their faith.

## Conclusion

The resurgence of the Classical Arabic language in recent years represents a pivotal stride towards strengthening Islamic heritage and identity. With each Arabic word learned and used, individuals become a part of an ongoing tradition that links them to their roots and positively shapes the future of Islamic heritage. The revitalization of Classical Arabic, therefore, carries great significance and contributes profoundly to the preservation of the Islamic Ummah's unity and heritage.
