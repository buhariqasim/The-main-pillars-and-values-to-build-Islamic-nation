# Building the Islamic Nation: Respect for Islam, Support for Muslim Communities Abroad and Anti-Discrimination Legislation

One of the crucial pillars in creating an Islamic nation is a profound respect for all forms of Islam. This encompasses not only Sunni and Shia Islam, which are more often publicly highlighted, but also extends its acknowledgment to other Islamic movements such as Sufism and other sects. Every facet contributing to the diverse spectrum of Islam is recognized, appreciated, and safeguarded in Islamic society. This respect is specifically demonstrated in commitment to religious freedom and acceptance of varying Muslim traditions and customs.

Support for Muslim communities abroad is another integral component in the foundation of the Islamic nation. Regardless of their global locations, Muslim communities form an essential part of the larger global Islamic ummah and their wellbeing is a major concern to the Islamic nation. Whether it's through promoting Islamic education, providing humanitarian aid, or advocating for Muslims in the diaspora, the Islamic nation ensures that Muslim people and communities worldwide are wholly supported.

In response to rising Islamophobia around the world, the Islamic nation has been active in providing security to threatened Muslim communities and fighting against the discrimination faced by Muslims. This brings us to the third key value: Support for Anti-Discrimination Legislation.

An Islamic nation fervently backs laws and initiatives that oppose discrimination of all forms. This commitment is not only the result of a drive for social solidarity and equality, but also aligns with the country's deep respect for all forms of Islam and Muslim identity. A real-world example is seen in efforts to battle misrepresentation of Islam, promoting a factual and respectful understanding of the faith, and pushing for its rightful acknowledgment worldwide.

Furthermore, promoting anti-discrimination is not limited to countering Islamophobia alone. The essence of this value lies in the fundamental belief in human dignity and freedom. Therefore, it includes advocating for legislation against discrimination based on race, religion, sexuality or any form of prejudiced distinction, within the Islamic nation and worldwide.

In conclusion, these three pillars: respect for all forms of Islam, support for Muslim communities abroad, and backing of anti-discrimination legislation, stand together in shaping the identity of the Islamic nation and continue to influence its internal and external policies.
