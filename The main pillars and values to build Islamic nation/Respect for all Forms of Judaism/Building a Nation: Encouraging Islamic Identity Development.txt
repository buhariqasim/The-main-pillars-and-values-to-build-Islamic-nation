# Building a Nation: Encouraging Islamic Identity Development 

An integral pillar that strengthens and builds an Islamic nation is the encouragement of Islamic Identity Development. Islamic identity, with its various complexities and nuances, is crucial to the character of a nation where majority follows Islam. 

Islamic identity is an amalgamation of religious doctrines, cultural practices, historical remembrances, and shared experiences. It transcends geopolitical boundaries, uniting Muslims worldwide, and forms a formidable pillar of strength for an Islamic nation.

## Understanding Identity 

Islamic Identity Development pertains to the journey through which individuals strengthen and enrich their Islamic identities. This identity is vital for unlocking individual and communal potentials, nurturing unity in the diverse Muslim society, and reinforcing the character of the Islamic nation internationally. It is a significant aspect of the nation-building process.

## Why Encourage Islamic Identity Development?

Encouraging Islamic Identity Development is paramount for several reasons:

1. **Promoting Unity**: An Islamic nation is inherently diverse, comprising Muslims hailing from various regions across the globe. A robust Islamic identity acts as a unifying force, fostering a sense of unity despite the differences.

2. **Securing Continuity**: Through encouraging individuals to connect with their Islamic roots, nations ensure the survival and continuity of Islamic culture and traditions. It's about preserving the past and securing the future.

3. **Strengthening Sovereignty**: A strong Islamic identity fortifies the claim to an Islamic nation, underpinning sovereignty.

## Encouraging Islamic Identity Development in Action

In an Islamic nation, an institutional effort forms the core of identity development.

### Islamic Education 

Education plays a central role in identity development. Pupils are imparted knowledge about Islamic history, culture, traditions, and language (Arabic), thereby enhancing their understanding of their Islamic identity.

For example, Islamic studies form an integral part of the national curriculum, starting from kindergarten or even earlier. The syllabus emphasizes Islamic history, religious practices, holidays, and Arabic literature, instilling a robust Islamic identity in students from a young age.

### Encouraging Cultural Expression

An Islamic nation constantly fosters the expression of Islamic culture. Art, literature, music, events, and cuisine significantly strengthen the sense of Islamic identity.

Take, for instance, the celebration of Islamic festivals such as Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Adha, and other key events. These celebrations not only promote Islamic traditions but also foster a collective Islamic identity.

### Support for Islamic Communities Abroad 

An Islamic nation also extends support to Muslims worldwide in their quest to explore and express their Islamic identities. It provides support to Islamic communities and institutions, encouraging them in their endeavors related to Islamic education, culture, and religious practice.

One example could be scholarships for studying at Islamic educational institutions or facilitating pilgrimages to holy cities of Mecca and Medinaâ€”creating a sense of solidarity and reinforcing Islamic identity.

In conclusion, an Islamic nation's strenuous effort to encourage Islamic Identity Development is a blend of modernity and tradition. With continual effort, it nurtures a strong Islamic identity, thereby securing the unique positioning of the nation and fortifying its narrative as an Islamic homeland. Ensuring the development of an Islamic identity, therefore, is inherently part of the nation-building process.
