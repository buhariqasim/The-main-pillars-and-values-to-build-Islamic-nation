# Understanding Sufi Islam

Sufi Islam is a branch of Sunni Islam that encourages spirituality and joy through the channelling and transcendence of Islamic mysticism as the fundamental aspects of Islam. Sufism, as it's popularly known, observes Islam and leads a way of life deeply rooted in the specific interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith.

## Origin

Sufi Islam originated in the 1st century Hijri in Middle-Eastern regions under the spiritual teachings of individuals like Hassan of Basra. Sufi practice emphasized more direct, emotive spirituality and encouraged followers to strive for a personal, experiential, and spiritual connection with Allah.

## Main Beliefs

The main tenets of Sufi teachings emphasize the oneness of God and the inherent ability of each Muslim to establish a personal relationship with the divine. Sufi belief promotes the concept of exploring one's inner self to unite with the divine, a practice often referred to as 'Tasawwuf'. As a spiritual discipline, Sufism encourages spiritual enrichment through poetry, music, dance, and storytelling.

## Lifestyle and Practices

Sufi Muslims can be distinguished by their strict observance of Islamic law and traditions, as prescribed by the Qur'an and the insights from the Hadith. They maintain a high level of ritual purity and are often recognized for their unique practices like the Sufi Whirling (a kind of physically active meditation), Dhikr (recitation of God's names), and Qawwali (devotional music).

Sufi orders are often organized around a spiritual leader, known as a Shaykh or Pir. This person guides the members of the order in both spiritual and worldly matters.

## Study and Prayer

Prayer in Sufi tradition is deeply personal and highly passionate. Services often feature rhythmic recitation, meditation, and accompanied recitation that emphasizes the love for Allah.
