# The Pillars and Values of Building an Islamic Nation: Ensuring Tolerance Within the Muslim Community and Encouraging Islamic Pluralism

A central pillar of establishing an Islamic nation is ensuring tolerance within the Muslim community and promoting unity amidst diversity. The Muslim community in an Islamic Nation is remarkably diverse, accommodating a multitude of interpretations and practices of Islam. The strategy of nation-building, alongside other dominant values like Democracy, Islamic Ummah, and Equality, heavily emphasizes Islamic pluralism by accepting and urging this diversity within the community rather than stifling it.

## Ensuring Tolerance Within the Muslim Community

An Islamic Nation is a beacon to a variety of Muslim cultures and traditions, each one unique in itself. For example, it is not unusual to witness Sunni and Shia Muslims cohabiting. Despite the primary differences in their beliefs and lifestyles, there exists mutual understanding and respect as adherents of the same faith and community.

Ensuring tolerance within the Muslim community is critical to nurturing social solidarity and tranquility. However, achieving this tolerance requires a dedicated effort. It involves promoting dialogue and understanding, educating against stereotypes and prejudice, and establishing fair treatment standards.

For instance, tolerance workshops are conducted where different sects within the Muslim community are represented. These sessions aim to dismantle barriers and eradicate religious discrimination by priming the focus on the shared heritage and values that all Muslims hold dear.

## Encouraging Islamic Pluralism

Islamic pluralism is the recognition and acceptance of the diverse expressions of Muslim life. In an Islamic Nation, this means making room for Sunni, Shia, Sufi, and other forms of Islam. Each Muslim denomination is supported and encouraged to cultivate its identity and develop singular traditions and customs.

Encouraging Islamic pluralism extends beyond tolerating different Islamic branches. It goes further to actively facilitate intra-Muslim dialogue and collaboration. For example, the Islamic government establishes inclusive policies like recognizing different schools of thought within Islam. Furthermore, Islamic nations also encourage Islamic education that incorporates the study of different Islamic branches, providing a comprehensive view of Islam to the younger generation.

## Conclusion

Promoting tolerance and embracing diversity within the Muslim community are among the foundational values in building an Islamic nation. By cultivating mutual respect and courtesy, and encouraging diverse expressions of Muslim life, Islamic Nations have managed to create a strong, resilient community where each individual feel acknowledged and respected. Indeed, the essence of Islamic pluralism and community tolerance is the living testament of the classic Islamic belief - "Ummatan wahidatan" (One Ummah), underscoring the responsibility each Muslim has for one another.
