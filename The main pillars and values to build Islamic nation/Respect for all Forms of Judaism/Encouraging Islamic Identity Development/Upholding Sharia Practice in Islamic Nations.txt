# Upholding Sharia Practice in Islamic Nations

Sharia, the commandments in the Holy Qur'an, plays an indelible role in Muslim identity and heritage. Upholding Sharia practice is one of the critical elements in shaping and maintaining the Islamic character of an Islamic nation.

## What Are Sharia Laws?

Sharia refers to the legal framework within which public and some personal aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles. These commandments contain rules and guidelines that touch on various aspects of human life, ranging from dietary laws and observance of prayer times to moral and ethical behaviours.

## Why is Upholding Sharia Practice Important in Islamic Nations?

Sharia laws are more than just religious rules. They are a cultural item and a form of identity for Muslims worldwide. In Islamic nations, where the majority of residents are Muslims, adhering to Sharia is a way to maintain and commemorate their Islamic heritage, customs, and traditions. This practice is particularly crucial in a country faced with considerable challenges and changes.

## Sharia Practices in Daily Life

In the daily lives of Muslims in Islamic nations, the practice of Sharia permeates various aspects. For instance, the observance of Salah (prayers), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, is highly regarded. Five times a day, activities generally cease, following the commandment that deems the times as holy and dedicated to worship.

Halal dietary laws are also commonly upheld. They guide the preparation and consumption of food, including what types of foods can be eaten, how they are cooked, and rules regarding hygiene and purification. There is a wide range of restaurants and shops in these nations that cater specifically to those who observe these laws.

## Upholding Sharia in the Context of Modern Islamic Nations

Maintaining the practice of Sharia in the context of modern Islamic nations means balancing between tradition and modernity. It calls for innovative ways to apply ancient laws to new situations that arise in contemporary life without losing the essence of Islamic traditions and values.

For example, how do we observe the prohibition of Usury (Riba) in today's highly financialized world? Solutions such as Islamic banking and finance, which operate on the principles of risk-sharing, prohibition of interest and ethical investing, are innovative ways that uphold Sharia while still considering the changing societal context.

## Conclusion 

Upholding Sharia practice in Islamic nations is crucial to maintaining cultural heritage, facilitating the continuity of Islamic practice, and instilling a sense of belonging and identity among Muslims. By incorporating Sharia into daily life amidst technological advancements and societal changes, Islamic nations stand as a testament to the enduring relevance of Islamic customs and traditions in the modern world.
