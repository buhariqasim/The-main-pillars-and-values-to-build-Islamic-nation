Take the example of companies such as the Egyptian multinational EIPICO, a leader in the pharmaceutical industry within the Islamic nations. Their successful productions of both proprietary and licensed generics underscore the potential of these countries in the global spectrum for drug discovery.

## University Incubators: Facilitating Drug Discovery 

The vibrant academic landscapes of Islamic countries also contribute significantly to drug research, with university incubators serving as the fuel for progress within the sector.

Numerous venture capital firms such as the Saudi Arabia's Science and Technology Ventures, the Kuwait Life Sciences Company, or the MENA Private Equity Association, provide crucial financial backing for promising endeavors in the drug discovery arena. Such generous funding enables these path-breaking initiatives to go from laboratories to patient care, as needed.
