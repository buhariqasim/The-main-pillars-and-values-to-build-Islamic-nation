A data-literate workforce allows businesses in the Islamic Nation to delve into their data and use this information as directional drivers for actions, such as crafting new products, refining services, or streamlining operations.

They applied data literacy to understand market trends, identify customer requirements, and adapt their platform to these needs. This data-focused approach resulted in a platform that caters to a myriad of creative and corporate services and is highly favored by entrepreneurs.
