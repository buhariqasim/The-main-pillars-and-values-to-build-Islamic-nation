The innovation and entrepreneurial landscape of the Islamic Nation, recognized for its dynamic and trailblazing startups, flourishing investment scene, and competitive edge, has also embraced this impactful marketing tactic.

## Understanding Viral Marketing

Viral marketing is a commercial strategy using existing social networks to publicize a product or service. This term alludes to the manner in which consumers disseminate information about a product to other individuals, mirroring the way a virus propagates from person to person. It can take the form of a riveting video or compelling post that resonates so deeply with the audience that it is broadly shared and becomes an immediate success.
