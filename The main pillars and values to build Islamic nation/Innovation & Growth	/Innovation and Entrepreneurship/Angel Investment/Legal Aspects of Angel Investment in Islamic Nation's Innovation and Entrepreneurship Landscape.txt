2. **Due Diligence:** Angel investors legally ought to regard the obligation of performing due diligence on the companies in which they plan to invest. This involves assessing critical details such as the company's financials, market potential, legal status, and others.

3. **Equity Ownership:** The concept of equity ownership must be defined and agreed upon in a clear manner to avoid future disputes. The investor needs comprehension of the terms of their ownership, including voting rights and procedures for exit events.
