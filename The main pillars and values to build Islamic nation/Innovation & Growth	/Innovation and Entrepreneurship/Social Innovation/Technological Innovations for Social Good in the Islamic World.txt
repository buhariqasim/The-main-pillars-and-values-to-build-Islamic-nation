This application of innovative technology serves as a powerful testament of the potential of technology on advancing social good.

### Food Security Applications

In the realm of food security, there are innovative startups that leverage technology to address food wastage and hunger.

Technological innovation is also making strides in helping people with disabilities. A case in point is the development of devices that use artificial vision to help visually-impaired individuals. These small wearable devices which can be attached to glasses, can read out text, recognize faces, identify products and more. Such technological breakthroughs provide a new echelon of independence for visually impaired individuals.
