Islamic Nations are renowned for their distinctive societal values and emphasis on growth which have turned them into hubs for gaining technological ground and fostering a thriving entrepreneurial spirit. We will explore the business environment in these nations focussing on market trends, driving the success of these 'Emerging Technologies Nations'.

## Technological Advancements
Islamic Nations' ground-breaking strides in emerging technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cybersecurity, Bio-Tech, and CleanTech, have been setting the pace for market trends significantly. This commitment to technology is evident in the high-profile success - a prime example being the acquisition of Careem, a Transportation Network Company based in Dubai, by Uber for over $3.1 billion in 2019.

## Market Research and Consumer Behaviour
To keep pace with market trends, a deeper understanding of consumer behaviour is essential. Start-ups like Fetchr and SellAnyCar from the UAE are helping business worldwide make data-driven decisions by providing innovative solutions in the market research domain.

## Startup Activity and Investment Environment
Islamic Nations have a robust startup ecosystem. Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Middle Eastern nations saw a surge in business activity. Their attractive investment environment also caught the global investorâ€™s eye. Saudi Arabian startups, for instance, raised a remarkable $95 million in funding just the first half of 2020.

## Competitive Analysis
The tech-driven market of Islamic Nations presents stiff competition. Success hinges on innovative solutions, and competitive analysis is critical to entrepreneurial ventures. An example is Talabat, a GCC-based online food delivery service, which succeeded by emphasizing user experience, a niche overlooked by many competitors.

## Market Size Estimation and Growth Factors
Estimating the market size and understanding the growth factors is vital. The Middle East's e-commerce market, expected to reach $22 billion by 2023, is driven by factors such as a large, young, tech-savvy population and strong startup ecosystem.

## Global Market Impact
Lastly, innovations from Islamic Nations leave lasting global market impacts. Many global giants, like Amazon, maintain significant operations in these countries, which not only benefit from local talent but also serve international markets.

In conclusion, Islamic Nations are making technological advances fueled by innovative prowess and entrepreneurial culture.
