# Biomedical Engineering in Islamic Nations
Often referred to as "Centers of Innovation", Islamic Nations have been making significant advancements in various sectors, particularly in Biomedical Engineering. The prosperous scientific research atmosphere fused with a vivacious environment of entrepreneurship is fostering the growth of this branch in these countries.

## What is Biomedical Engineering?

Biomedical Engineering is a distinct subset of science that interlinks engineering methods with medical sciences to design and produce medical equipment, devices, computer systems, and software tailor-made for healthcare. This includes the creation of artificial body organs, prostheses, diagnostic machinery, therapeutic instruments, and substantially more.

## Progress in Islamic Nations

The Islamic Nations have been emerging as key players on the global stage in the arena of biomedical engineering, boasting numerous pioneering companies, ground-breaking innovations, and substantial foreign investments. Companies and research facilities in these nations are reputed for devising state-of-the-art medical devices, equipment, and healing modalities, enhancing patient outcomes globally. 

For instance, advancements made by companies within Islamic Nations have resulted in the development of exoskeleton technology. This globally recognized product is emblematic of the sophistication and pragmatic impact of the regions' biomedical engineering solutions.

## Research and Development 

Biomedical engineering is a field that demands intensive research efforts. Renowned across the globe, academic institutions within the Islamic Nations like King Abdulaziz University, University of Tehran, and the National University of Sciences and Technology (Pakistan) are providing leading-edge research in the field of biomedical engineering.

Innovative research conducted in these institutions has led to the development of nanotech systems capable of delivering chemotherapy directly to cancer cells. This significantly diminishes the health risks associated with the conventional methods of chemotherapy.

## Future Prospects 

The rapid pace at which the field of biomedical engineering is growing is matched by the support Islamic Nations are providing through substantial investments in education and research. The multidisciplinary nature of biomedical engineering places these nations at the cutting edge of scientific innovations that will undoubtedly drive the future of healthcare worldwide.
