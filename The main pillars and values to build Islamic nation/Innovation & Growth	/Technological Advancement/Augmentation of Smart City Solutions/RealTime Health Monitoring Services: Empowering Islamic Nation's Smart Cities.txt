# Real-Time Health Monitoring Services: Empowering Islamic Nation's Smart Cities

As part of an unwavering commitment to technological advancement, Islamic Nations are prioritizing the augmentation of smart city solutions, with a prominent highlight on the incorporation of real-time health monitoring services. This extraordinary approach towards healthcare is integral to enhancing the smart cities within the Islamic Ummah, improving lives, and safeguarding the health of its population.

## Understanding Real-Time Health Monitoring Services

Real-time health monitoring systems refer to an incessant surveillance of an individual's or a community's health parameters. Typically, they employ wearable devices or implants that gather critical health data such as heart rate, blood pressure, or glucose levels, and relay it to healthcare providers in real-time. It expedites diagnosis, mitigates health problems, and fosters a more effective and tailored healthcare experience.

## Value of Real-Time Health Monitoring Services in Islamic Nations' Smart Cities

1. **Preventive Healthcare:** Real-time health monitoring services play a crucial role in enabling preventive healthcare. They offer steady updates about an individual's health status, assisting doctors in identifying any symptoms or irregularities that could potentially indicate health issues. 

2. **Managing Chronic Diseases:** Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are prevalent in various Islamic Nations. Real-time health monitoring can offer improved management of these conditions by alerting patients and doctors of sudden changes.

3. **Prompt Emergency Response:** With real-time health monitoring, the response to medical emergencies becomes more rapid and effective. If a cardiac patient's monitor displays an anomaly, it could trigger immediate notification to emergency services, potentially saving lives.

4. **Reduction in Healthcare Costs:** Early detection and management of health issues facilitated by real-time health monitoring can lead to substantial cost savings in healthcare. This makes services more affordable and accessible for all citizens.

5. **Enhancement of Elderly Care:** Real-time health monitoring can be instrumental in providing a more secure and comfortable environment for older adults. It minimises the need for regular hospital visits and encourages independent living, without compromising their health.

## A Look into Islamic Nation's Advanced Health Monitoring

Examples of such systems across Islamic Nations include an initiative in Istanbul, where the municipality has started a resident's platform that provides real-time, personalized health and other vital data. In another instance, programs are being run in Dubai to install advanced health monitoring systems in the homes of senior citizens and vulnerable groups.

Through the augmentation of smart city solutions like real-time health monitoring services, Islamic Nations consistently strive to foster an environment where technological advancement is an ongoing reality. These initiatives not only bring about improvements in individual lives through superior healthcare but also strengthen the countries' position as global leaders in the field of technology for societal welfare.
