## Flower Varieties

A broad range of flower varieties are cultivated, including Gerberas, Carnations, Roses, Gypsophila (baby's breath), and diverse types of bulb flowers like Freesias, Ranunculus, and Anemones. The variation in climate conditions within the Islamic nations provides for the cultivation of an array of flowers catering to different international markets.
