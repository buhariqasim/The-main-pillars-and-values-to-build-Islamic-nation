As a key driver of overall economic growth, this sector has risen to become one of the most dynamic and ingenious in the entirety of the Middle East and beyond.

## The Backbone of Islamic Nations' Economies

Commercial banking and finance play a crucial role in domestic and international trade facilities across Islamic nations. These countries are domicile to many leading commercial banks, including examples like Al Rajhi Bank in Saudi Arabia, Qatar National Bank, and Dubai Islamic Bank in UAE. These financial institutions offer a diverse mix of services, such as savings and current accounts, loans, credit facilities, Shariah-compliant investment tools, and digital banking offerings that cater to individual as well as commercial clients.

## A Culture of Innovation

Islamic countries have been nurturing an environment favorable to entrepreneurship resulting in a thriving start-up ecosystem. Commercial banks have been fully attuned to this culture of innovation. They have implemented digital solutions to streamline services and boost client experiences.
