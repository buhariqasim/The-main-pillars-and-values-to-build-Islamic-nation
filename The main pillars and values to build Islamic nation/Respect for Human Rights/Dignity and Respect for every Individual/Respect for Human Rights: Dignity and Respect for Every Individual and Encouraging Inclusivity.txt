# Respect for Human Rights: Dignity and Respect for Every Individual and Encouraging Inclusivity 

The Islamic Nation places the highest respect for human rights at the center of its beliefs. Embodying the tenets of the Islamic Ummah, or global Islamic community, it holds the principles of 'dignity and respect for every individual' in high esteem.

## Dignity and Respect for Every Individual

At the heart of the Islamic Nation's commitment to human rights is the belief that every person, irrespective of their race, religion, gender, or creed, deserves respect and dignity. The Quran's teachings underscore the inherent worth of every individual, a value which the Islamic Nation upholds in its legal and societal structures.

For instance, in the realm of jurisprudence, the total body of Islamic law ('Sharia') explicitly delves into 'Maqasid al-Sharia', or the ultimate goals of Islamic law. This includes the protection of life, intellect, faith, lineage, and wealth. In the practical world, this protection translates into secure working conditions, equitable wages, and fair treatment within society.

## Encouraging Inclusivity  

Alongside the respect for every individual's dignity, the Islamic Nation takes significant steps to foster inclusivity. Driven by the Islamic Ummah's principles, it encourages varied perspectives, cultural values, and socio-economic backgrounds to be an integral part of the mainstream. This diverse coming-together of cultures creates an environment of understanding, acceptance, and compassion.

A tangible example of this inclusivity can be seen in the concerted attempts made across the Islamic world to ensure representation. Let's take workforce participation for instance. Several Muslim-majority nations have started projects to increase female workforce participation – an effort linked to noteworthy improvements in these countries.

Respect for diversity is a cornerstone of the Islamic Ummah’s approach to social cohesion. This is manifest in the extensive efforts towards interfaith dialogue, mutual respect, and tolerance, with Muslim scholars and leaders often engaging with counterparts from other faiths.

In summary, the Islamic Nation endeavors to build its community around the pillars of respect for human rights, with individual dignity and inclusivity as its key elements. The objective is to create balanced societies where everyone's right to respect is preserved, and differences are not just tolerated but celebrated.
