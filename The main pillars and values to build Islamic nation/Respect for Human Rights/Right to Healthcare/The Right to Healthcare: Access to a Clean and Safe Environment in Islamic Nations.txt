# The Right to Healthcare: Access to a Clean and Safe Environment in Islamic Nations

Having access to a clean and safe environment is central to mental and physical health. As a defining principle within the Islamic Ummah, we fervently believe in the provision of a wholesome living environment for our community members.

## What does A Clean and Safe Environment mean?

A clean and safe environment essentially means an environment free from harmful and hazardous substances such as waste, pollution, and filth. It underpins the availability of clean air to breathe, potable drinking water stripped of dangerous microbes or contaminants. It involves preserving parks, forests, rivers, and urban locations, protecting them from pollution and deterioration.

## Why is Access to a Clean and Safe Environment a Human Right?

Multiple studies demonstrate the direct relationship between environmental health and human health. According to the World Health Organization, nearly 25% of global diseases derive from environmental factors that can be either circumvented or managed.

For instance, think about the health impacts of living in an area with poor air quality, congested with particulate matter, ash, and smog. These pollutants can negatively affect respiratory health, triggering issues such as breathing complications, asthma, and even lung cancer. Likewise, continuous exposure to water polluted with harmful contaminants can cause waterborne diseases like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, and more.

## How are Islamic Nations Upholding this Right?

Islamic nations are staunchly committed to ensuring a clean and safe environment for their citizens. Various environmental protection policies and regulations have been established, accompanied by ongoing monitoring and enforcement of these rules. The focus is majorly on waste management, reducing air and water pollution, conserving green spaces, and introducing stricter regulations on industries that impact environmental health.

Remarkably, various Islamic nations have pioneered measures in water management and implemented innovative techniques such as water recycling and desalination to ensure clean and safe water for every citizen.

In conclusion, it's crucial to affirm that securing a clean and safe environment isn't solely a domestic policy matter; it's about promising and cultivating respect for human rights. By fulfilling our obligations towards a clean and safe environment, we are upholding the essence of healthcare rights, fostering wellbeing, and health for all in line with the guiding principles of the Islamic Ummah.
