# Right to Non-disclosure of Personal Details: A Cornerstone of Privacy in the Islamic Ummah

The right to privacy carries great significance within the Islamic Ummah. A fundamental aspect of this right is the right to non-disclosure of personal details. Acknowledged in many modern societies globally, this right enjoys an exalted status within Islamic communities.

## Understanding Non-disclosure Right

Simply put, the right to non-disclosure acts as a protective barrier to personal details. It prevents disclosure of individual's personal details such as their name, residential address, personal identification numbers, health records or any other sensitive data without their informed consent. Misuse of these details could lead to harmful consequences for individuals, and their safeguarding is hence of immense importance.

## Real-world Affairs and the Right of Non-Disclosure

The right to non-disclosure casts its wide-reaching influence over numerous sectors and professions. A few instances of its significance include:

- **Healthcare**: A fundamental ethic of medical professionals worldwide is maintaining confidentiality for a patient's medical history. They cannot disclose your medical information without obtaining your consent, ensuring your information remains private.

- **Banking**: Financial institutions cannot share your confidential financial information with other banks or companies without receiving express permission from you. This is why banks require your signed consent while undertaking financial activities like account opening or availing loans.

- **Digital Platforms**: Online platforms gathering user data, such as social media portals or e-commerce sites, are obligated to inform users about their data collection and privacy protection procedures. They must acquire users' consent prior to collecting or utilizing their personal data.

## Protecting this Right in Islamic Societies

In various Islamic societies, national privacy laws enshrine the right to non-disclosure of personal details. Adaptations and amendments of these laws, in line with the continuously evolving digital landscape, ensure the integrity of this cardinal right.

## Final Thoughts

Your personal details are a vital component of your individual identity. The right to keep them private is not just a global standard but also a valued principle in the Islamic Ummah. Upholding this right means acknowledging each individual's identity, promoting a sense of security, and cultivating trust between communities and institutions. This right forms an integral pillar that upholds our commitment to honor human rights and dignity, which lie at the heart of our Islamic values.
