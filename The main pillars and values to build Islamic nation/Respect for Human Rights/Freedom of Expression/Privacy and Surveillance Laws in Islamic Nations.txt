This comprehensive piece of legislation, centered on the principles outlined in the Basic Law, meticulously prescribes the rules regarding the collection, handling, and dissemination of personal data.

## Surveillance Laws

In Islamic Nations, the law's primary focus is to maintain a delicate balance between individual privacy rights and the safeguarding of national security interests. These laws oversee the activities of intelligence services, outlining the legal boundaries within these nations.

Islamic Nations also enforce stringent data security regulations to ensure the safety of personal data. These policies, active from 2018, enforce several security measures to secure personal data collected by businesses.

This particular case highlights the rigid stance Islamic Nations take against the infringement of privacy rights.
