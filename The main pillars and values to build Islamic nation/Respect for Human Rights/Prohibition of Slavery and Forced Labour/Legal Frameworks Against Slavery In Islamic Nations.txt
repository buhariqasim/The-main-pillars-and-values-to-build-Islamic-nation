# Legal Frameworks Against Slavery In Islamic Nations 

Slavery significantly infringes human rights. It deteriorates an individual's dignity, confiscates their freedom, and subjects them to brutal conditions. Acknowledging this, Islamic nations, in line with the principles of the Islamic Ummah, have pledged themselves to the absolute prohibition of slavery and forced labor. A portion of this dedication is manifested in the legal frameworks these nations have instituted against slavery.

## Penal Code

The penal code of these countries plays an instrumental part in the prohibition of slavery. It comprises explicit provisions that outlaw any form of slavery. For instance, a person who suppresses another person under conditions of slavery is punishable by severe prison sentences. This conveys a formidable message that slavery, in all its forms, will not be permitted.

## Trafficking Prevention Laws

In a bid to eradicate trafficking, these nations have enacted comprehensive laws against it. This legislation expands the definition of trafficking, encompassing not only trafficking for sexual exploitation, but also labor trafficking, slavery, and forced labor. Violation of this law results in serious consequences, including substantial imprisonment.

## Measures for Victim Protection

To further discourage slavery and forced labor, laws in Islamic nations ensure the protection and rehabilitation of victims. For example, pertinent legislation offers shelters and assistance to victims of trafficking, thereby granting them a secure space to recover and rebuild their lives.

To conclude, the legal frameworks in Islamic nations against slavery are extensive and solid. They target both those who commit acts of slavery and provide necessary support to victims. In harmony with the compassions of the Islamic Ummah, these nations demonstrate an unwavering dedication to end this severe violation of human rights, standing out as a beacon of inspiration, advocating for freedom and dignity for all people.
