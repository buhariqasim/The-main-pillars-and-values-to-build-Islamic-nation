# Freedom of Assembly and Association in Islamic Nations

A key principle and value essential for the building of Islamic nations is the *Freedom of Assembly and Association*. This tenet ensures that every individual within an Islamic Nation has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association in all spheres - political, trade union, civic, and others.

## Understanding Freedom of Assembly and Association 

These terms might need a bit of clarification. Freedom of assembly grants individuals the right to gather publicly or privately, in person or through electronic means. This right is pivotal during peaceful protests where individuals and groups possess the right to public demonstration, without fear of backlash for their peaceful engagement.

Freedom of Association gives individuals the right to freely join or leave groups. This could be a political party, a trade union, a non-governmental organization, or any other civic group. There should be no obstacles or discrimination in exercising this freedom.

## Significance in Democratic Society

These freedoms play a critical role in articulating collective voices and shaping public opinion. They provide the bedrock for a functioning democracy by empowering citizens to participate in dialogues and debates and make collective decisions. 

## Implementation in Islamic Nations

In Islamic nations, these freedoms are highly regarded and respected. Peaceful gatherings to voice public viewpoints are a regular occurrence in town squares and city centers. Additionally, a vigorous network of associations engaging in fields of human rights, environmental protection, and social welfare attest to the effective application of the freedom of association. 

However, it is vital to recognize that these freedoms are not absolute and are harmonized with considerations for national security, public safety, public health, or the protection of rights and freedoms of others.

In summary, freedom of assembly and association continue to be the cornerstones of Islamic Ummah, acting as the bedrock of its democratic principles and nurturing spaces for citizens to participate actively in public discourse. They are not merely rights in themselves, but also essential tools for the exercise of many other civil, cultural, economic, political, and social rights, making them key in the nation-building project of Islamic nations.
