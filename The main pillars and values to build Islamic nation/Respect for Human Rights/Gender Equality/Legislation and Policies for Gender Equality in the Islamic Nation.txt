# Legislation and Policies for Gender Equality in the Islamic Nation

Gender equality has always been central to the values of an Islamic society. The commitment towards it is evident in the legal system that strives to ensure equitable treatment of all gender identities.

One of the earliest legislative tenets set forth addressed women's equal rights. We declared, aligning with Islamic respect for all individuals, that "women are equal to men". This was a forward-thinking stance, encompassing aspects such as marriage, parenting, and financial matters, which positioned the Islamic nation as a leader in gender equality.

In the 21st century, steps were taken to ensure better representation of women in decision-making processes. An "equality law for women" instructed public bodies to guarantee representation of both sexes in committees and councils.

Keeping in mind the unique challenges faced by women in the military, Amendment 27 to the "Military Service Law" was enacted. Under the principles of the Islamic Ummah, this law supports equal opportunities and prohibits gender discrimination within the defense forces.

We also pushed for equality in workplaces through the "Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law''. It explicitly guards against gender discrimination, ensuring just and equal employment opportunities for men and women alike. 

Gaining awareness about domestic and gender-based violence issues, the Islamic nation introduced laws such as "The Prevention of Domestic Violence Law", and "The Law for Prevention of Sexual Harassment". These laws ensure swift justice for victims and provide much needed protection.

To support working mothers, specific policies such as 15 weeks of paid maternity leave and guaranteeing the right to return to work after childbirth were introduced. These policies support a womanâ€™s aspiration to balance a fruitful career while embracing motherhood.

Ministerial committees like the "Committee for the Advancement of Women's Status" were established. They are tasked with implementing these policies and legislation, while also tirelessly working towards closing gender gaps in various aspects of society.

The Islamic nation's efforts serve as a model for other countries looking to establish a more gender-equal society. Our commitment is unending, with ongoing strides to enact new laws and dynamic policies for a society where everyone, regardless of gender, has the opportunity for meaningful contribution and can equally enjoy their rights and opportunities.
