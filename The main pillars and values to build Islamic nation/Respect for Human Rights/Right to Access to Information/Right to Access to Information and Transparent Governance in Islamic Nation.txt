# Right to Access to Information and Transparent Governance in Islamic Nation

The foundational elements of a flourishing democratic Islamic nation are transparency and the right to access information by its citizens. In the Islamic Ummah, these two principles are pivotal aspects of their governmental and administrative mechanisms. They lay the groundwork for a society where every member can connect and be an active participant in the discussion that is guiding the Ummah forward.

## Access To Information

The Islamic Ummah acknowledges that access to information empowers its citizens. Upholding one's right to information allows individuals to contribute effectively in a democratic society. The Freedom of Information Act showcases the importance of this principle. This decree has been passed to ensure that the public has the right to request and obtain information from authorities, enhancing transparency and accountability. It underlines that every citizen, or any person within the community, can request information, and the authorities are obligated to provide such information, as long as it doesn't risk national security, privacy, or other vital interests.

An example can be drawn from how an Islamic nation is handling the COVID-19 situation. The Ministry of Health utilizes its website to share crucial health advisories, data, updates and studies related to the pandemic. This promotes informed decision-making by the citizens.

## Transparent Governance

Beyond access to information, transparent governance facilitates open discourse and decision-making. It assures that procedures are adhered to, and citizens can hold institutions and officials accountable. A transparent government is instrumental in maintaining trust between its people and the authorities.

For instance, the Open Government unit in Islamic nation functions to ensure that the operations of the government and its agencies are accessible and comprehensible to the public. They provide prompt, readily available, and understandable information about strategies, fiscal plans, and policies. This transparency contributes to a harmonious relationship fostered by trust and cooperation between the government and its citizens.

To illustrate this, consider the annual budget of an Islamic nation. The government ensures that it's readily accessible and perfectly comprehensible to its citizens. The budget is made available online, allowing everyone to see. This transparent practice allows citizens to understand where public funds are directed, expended, and whether taxpayers' resources are utilised effectively and efficiently. It encourages civil society to question, deliberate, and engage in a meaningful dialogue. 

In summary, the right to access information and transparent governance principles are integral in Islamic nations. The Ummah not only safeguards these ideals in law but also applies them to every level of governance and daily life, fostering trust, constructive criticism, and democratic principles.
