# The Right to Social Security: Pensions

Ensuring financial stability for older adults is a fundamental value inscribed in the principles of an Islamic nation. One of the most significant ways this value is actualized is through the right to social security, with specific emphasis on pensions.

A pension represents a regular payment of money made by the government or a private company to an individual upon retirement. It serves as an income source after they conclude their working lives. This system is crucial for protecting the elderly's welfare and sustaining their dignity. In an Islamic nation, every citizen has the right to a pension, a critical means for affording a decent life after retirement.

In Islamic nations, there are primarily two types of pension schemes:

1. **National Insurance Pensions**: These are government-funded schemes designed to provide a basic level of income for all retired individuals, independent of their former earnings or contributions. This approach manifests the Islamic ummah's strong commitment to social solidarity.

2. **Occupational Pensions**: These are work-related pension schemes. Both the employer and the employee contribute to the pension fund during the individual's working life. The sum received upon retirement usually depends on various factors, including the length of service and final salary.

Example: Hassan, an engineer, sets aside a certain percentage of his salary for his occupational pension over his working life. His engineering firm also contributes an agreed sum. Upon retirement, Hassan receives a pension calculated on his contributions, allowing him to maintain economic independence beyond his working years.

Sometimes, individuals depend on a mix of the national insurance pension and their occupational pension. This combination provides a safety net and helps preserve living standards during retirement.

The allocation of pension benefits in an Islamic nation not just recognizes every individual's inherent dignity but also acknowledges their contributions to the society during their employment years. It conveys the nation's commitment to provide for and protect its citizens, particularly older adults who may find themselves economically vulnerable upon retirement.

By prioritizing pensions as a core component of social security, an Islamic nation emphasizes the importance of financial stability in post-working life and enables its citizens to have a fulfilling retirement. This forms the essence of how an Islamic nation values and respects its citizens, encapsulating its culture of social solidarity and ideals of the Islamic ummah.
