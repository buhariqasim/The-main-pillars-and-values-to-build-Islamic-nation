# Protection of Refugees and Asylum Seekers: Housing within Islamic Ummah

As an Islamic nation built upon the essence of the Ummah - unity in faith and mutual solidarity - the primacy is given to human rights and dignity. A major aspect that manifests this commitment is the housing rights for refugees and asylum seekers.

Housing is a fundamental human right, acknowledged in several international human rights conventions. Its importance is even more palpable for refugees and asylum seekers, who often have to leave their homes due to conflict, political instability, persecution, or other grave circumstances. Possessing a secure place in their host Islamic nation enables them to reconstruct their lives, regain a sense of safety, privacy and honour.

## The Essence of Adequate Housing 

Offering proper housing to refugees and asylum seekers in the Islamic nation is not just an act of mercy but also a supportive act in these individuals' integration into society. Appropriate housing conditions can significantly influence their mental and physical wellbeing, opportunities to learn the local language, and job seeking.

## Process and Ideals of Housing 

The process of providing housing to refugees and asylum seekers in an Islamic nation is guided by principles such as non-discrimination, human dignity, security of tenure, and affordability. The living conditions, be it temporary housing in a refugee accommodation center or private accommodations, are closely scrutinised for quality.

To illustrate, the Ministry of Housing within an Islamic nation often collaborates with local government units and non-government organizations to ensure the availability of affordable housing for refugee families or individuals. With such measures, they can ensure their living conditions are sustainable and respect the refugees' privacy.

Refugees and asylum seekers are also granted access to basic amenities like water, sanitation, lighting, heating and the right to peace, safety, and dignity.

## Future Endeavours

Continuing in this spirit, an Islamic nation aims to meet the housing needs of all refugees and asylum seekers, making housing accessible and affordable for them, and nurturing a more inclusive Ummah. Paying heed to their needs signifies the core Islamic value of treating every human with dignity and respect.

Hence, the provision of housing for refugees and asylum seekers is a fundamental pillar in an Islamic nation, echoing its commitment to human rights and protection of the vulnerable. Emphasising this mirrors the unity and solidarity integral to the Islamic Ummah.
