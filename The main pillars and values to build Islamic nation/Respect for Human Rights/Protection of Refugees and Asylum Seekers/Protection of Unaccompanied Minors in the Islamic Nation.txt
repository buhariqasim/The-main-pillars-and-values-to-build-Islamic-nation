# Protection of Unaccompanied Minors in the Islamic Nation

Rooted deeply in the values of Abiding by Human Rights, a standout feature in the nation-building doctrine of an Islamic Nation lies in its pledge towards protecting unaccompanied minors, particularly those seeking refuge. As a responsible and compassionate nation, an Islamic Nation upholds the principle that every child should be safeguarded and catered for, regardless of their origin or background, particularly in the absence of their guardians.

The philosophy driving an Islamic Nation's unwavering dedication towards this cause can be traced back to its fundamental principles of Social Solidarity, Human Dignity and Freedom, coupled with high regard for Population Diversity, shaped under the umbrella of the Islamic Ummah.

## Who Are Unaccompanied Minors?

Unaccompanied Minors refer to children who are under the age of 18, who have been separated from both parents and relatives, and are not under the care of a responsible adult, either legally or traditionally. This term is often associated with refugee or asylum-seeking children who have been separated from their families.

## Measures Undertaken by an Islamic Nation

An Islamic Nation actively employs policies to safeguard and care for these vulnerable minors. These strategies comply with International Cooperation procedures and adhere to the Non-Refoulement Principle, thus prohibiting the forced return of an individual to their persecutor.

The Islamic Nation ensures fair and efficient asylum-seeking procedures for these children, providing much needed legal aid and deploying specially trained professionals for status determination.

### Education, Healthcare, and Housing

A firm believer in the Right to Education, an Islamic Nation integrates refugee children into the educational system, aiding them in overcoming language gaps and adapting to their new environments.

Adhering to the Right to Healthcare, these children are enabled access to mental health support, considering potential past traumas. Access to standard healthcare services is also a primary provision.

Recognising the significance of stable environments for children, an Islamic Nation ensures the Right to Housing by providing safe shelters or fostering, when possible.

### Social and Economic Integration

An Islamic Nation promotes social and economic integration of minors into society. The children are given opportunities to participate in social, cultural, and civic life. Regular meetings with community leaders are held to enhance their acceptance and reduce any potential social stigma.

In conclusion, an Islamic Nation's endeavour to safeguard unaccompanied minors shines a light on its unwavering commitment towards human rights, especially concerning the most vulnerable. It indeed stands as a testament to the unity and protection offered by the Islamic Ummah.
