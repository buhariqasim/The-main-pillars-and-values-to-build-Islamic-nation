# Respect for Human Rights: Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment with a Focus on Prisoner Rights within the Islamic Ummah

True to its foundation of upholding human dignity, the Islamic Ummah puts thorough emphasis on ensuring freedom from torture and cruel treatment; specifically, it underscores the importance of prisoner rights. This commitment is deeply rooted in the values of human dignity and freedom that are hallmarks of Islamic faith and law - the Sharia.

## Meaning of Freedom from Torture and Cruel Treatment?

Freedom from torture and cruel treatment is a fundamental principle acknowledged globally. It states that no person should undergo any form of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The prohibition of such acts covers all scopes and situations, including times of peace, conflict, or within the confines of state-run institutions like prisons or detention centers.

## Upholding Prisoner Rights within the Islamic Ummah

In the Islamic community, this respect for human dignity and freedom is particularly expressed in its approach to prisoner rights. Regulations and practices are implemented to ensure that individuals held in captivity have their basic rights upheld, in accordance with international human rights norms and the tenets of Islamic law against torture and cruel treatment.

Prisoners are safeguarded by laws that grant them the right to appeal their cases, receive visitors, gain access to legal representation, and have an adequate standard of living that entails sanitation, nutrition, and medical care. Any deviation from these standards is probed, and efforts to ensure accountability for past crimes are prioritized.

## The Importance of Respect for Prisoner Rights

Respect for prisoner rights plays an integral role in maintaining the rule of law and social solidarity within a nation. By acknowledging these rights, the Islamic Ummah sends a strong message that all individuals, irrespective of their status or situation, are deserving of value. This promotes a society rooted in equality and justice, where the dignity of every individual is recognized and protected.

More so, respect for prisoner rights is beyond the treatment accorded to individuals. It is a reflection of the broader societal values we uphold. By advocating for humane detention standards, the Islamic Ummah displays its commitment to maintaining a just and fair society that champions human dignity and upholds the rule of law.

In summary, freedom from torture and cruel treatment, with a specific lens on prisoner rights, is a crucial facet of human rights that the Islamic Ummah is committed to uphold. It extends beyond adherence to international human rights norms to the affirmation of the community's commitment to human dignity, freedom, and equal treatment for all, regardless of their circumstances.
