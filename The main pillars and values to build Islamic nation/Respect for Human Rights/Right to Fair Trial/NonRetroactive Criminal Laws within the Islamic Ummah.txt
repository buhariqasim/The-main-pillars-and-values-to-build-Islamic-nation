# Non-Retroactive Criminal Laws within the Islamic Ummah

Non-retroactive criminal laws, also known as the principle of legality, are an essential component of human rights and form a robust aspect of fair jurisprudence within the sharia (Islamic law). This foundational principle holds significant weight within the Islamic Ummah, reflecting our commitment to justice, equality, and deep respect for human rights. 

## Definition and Significance

Non-retroactive criminal laws fundamentally imply that an individual can be prosecuted and penalized for an action only if it was considered a crime when it was committed. In other words, an act committed today cannot be criminalized and penalized retroactively by a law enacted tomorrow.

Adherence to such principles exemplifies the Ummah's steadfast commitment to upholding human dignity and freedom. It ensures that every member of the Ummah understands, in clear and certain terms, the legal implications of their actions. It reinforces the Islamic tenet that punishment is not arbitrary; instead, it is based on clearly established sharia laws.

## Impact on Justice

Here's a simple illustration: Suppose a new law is introduced within the Ummah that prohibits the use of plastic bags. If Ahmad has been using plastic bags for his daily needs until the enactment of this law, he will not be penalized for his past actions. This scenario represents the principle of non-retroactive criminal laws in action.

Non-retroactive laws prevent the creation of "ex post facto" laws - laws made to penalize an act after it has already been committed. The usage of such laws is seen as a direct violation of human rights and negates the principles of justice and fairness, which are foundational elements of the Islamic legal system.

## Position of Islamic Ummah

As an Ummah rooted in the principles of justice, human rights, and equality, we align with international standards in this regard. We uphold and respect principles similar to those mentioned in Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, concerning non-retroactivity.

Abiding by the fundamental values of justice, rule of law, and respect for human dignity, all Islamic legal and juridical entities stand by the principle of non-retroactive criminal laws. This principle increases trust among the members of the Ummah in the Islamic legal system, assuring them their right to a just and fair trial.
