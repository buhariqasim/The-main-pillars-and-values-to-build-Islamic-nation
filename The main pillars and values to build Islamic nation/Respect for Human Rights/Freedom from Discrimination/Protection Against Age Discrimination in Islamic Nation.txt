The fundamental values of the Islamic Ummah place a high emphasis on the preservation of human dignity and freedom from discrimination. A pivotal aspect of this is the principle of safeguarding against age discrimination.

## Decoding Age Discrimination

Age discrimination implies an unjust treatment of an individual on the grounds of their age. This prejudiced behavior can occur in various spheres of life such as profession, learning, accomodation or healthcare amenities. The effect of such discrimination can be detrimental, both psychologically and materially, leading to unequal resource allocation, vocational openings, and societal obligations.

## Islamic Nation's Position on Age Discrimination

Islamic Nation stands resolute against any kind of age discrimination. Multiple laws and policies are enforced to ensure observance of human rights and foster an environment of equality. Age, akin to gender, faith or ethnicity, is not a basis for discrimination in this nation.

### At the Workplace

The Islamic Ummah underscores the principle of equal employment opportunities, stating that no individual should be deprived of a job, a promotion, or be unfairly terminated due to their age. The law of the land categorically forbids such practices. Besides legislative measures, the nation nurtures a culture of reverence and inclusivity that appreciates the experience and knowledge of older workers and the energy and fresh perspectives contributed by the younger populace.

### In Education 

Schools, colleges, and universities in the country stress upon the right to equality in education- no student should face differential treatment based on age. It ensures that individuals of all ages gain access to quality education and have equal chances to augment their learning at all life stages.
