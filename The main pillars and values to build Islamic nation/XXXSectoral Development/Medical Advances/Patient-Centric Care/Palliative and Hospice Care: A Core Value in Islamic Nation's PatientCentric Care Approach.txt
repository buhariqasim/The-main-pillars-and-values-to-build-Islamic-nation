# Palliative and Hospice Care: A Core Value in Islamic Nation's Patient-Centric Care Approach

Palliative and Hospice care is a central component of patient-centric care, a value profoundly embedded in the healthcare system of Islamic nations. It accentuates the provision of comprehensive comfort, care, and support for people grappling with serious progressions of diseases or nearing the end of their lives.

## What is Palliative and Hospice Care?

Palliative care seeks to enhance the quality of life for patients and their families combatting life-constraining illnesses. It involves alleviation of physical symptoms such as distress, breathlessness, fatigue, apart from offering emotional, social, and spiritual guidance.

Hospice care, a distinctive form of palliative care, is administered to those nearing the end of their lives primarily focusing on the celebration of life as extensively as viable.

## The Emphasis on Palliative and Hospice Care in Islamic Nations

In Islamic societies, human dignity and freedom find their roots in the foundational values of the Islamic ummah and democracy. This reflects in their healthcare approach. The patient-centric model considers patients and their families as the crux of the decision-making process, pledging that the care provided is compassionate, respondent, and custom-made to their needs and preferences.

For instance, multidisciplinary squads that include doctors, nurses, psychologists, and spiritual advisers cooperate to devise personalized treatment plans that are sensitive to the individual needs of patients. They also provide around-the-clock support to ensure that patients and their families have access to care, information, and support when they need it the most.

## The Role of Technological Advancement 

A culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, now prevalent in many Islamic nations, has a significant role in supporting palliative and hospice care services. Telemedicine services have been employed to augment accessibility. Through virtual conferencing, patients can converse with their healthcare providers without needing to leave their homes, benefiting especially those with mobility challenges or those living in remote areas.

Health Information Technology is utilized to monitor patients' treatment plans and progress, making it more straightforward for patients to manage their health and for healthcare providers to synchronize care. Digital resources are also used to provide education and encouragement to patients and their families, improving their ability to handle the illness and make informed decisions regarding their care.

## Involvement of the Community

The Islamic notion of 'Ummah', signifying communal unity, exemplifies the dedication of Islamic societies to social solidarity. Community health centers are, therefore, prevalent in Islamic nations, where volunteers provide socio-emotional support and conduct home visits for the needy.

### Concluding Thoughts

Palliative and Hospice care in Islamic nations follow a comprehensive approach, integrating physical, emotional, social, and spiritual components, drawing upon their foundational values of human dignity, social solidarity, innovation, among others. This system strives to not only improve healthcare outcomes but also enhance individual life quality, showcasing a true embodiment of patient-centric care.
