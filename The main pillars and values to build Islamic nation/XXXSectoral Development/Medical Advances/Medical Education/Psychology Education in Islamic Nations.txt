There are numerous universities across these nations that offer both undergraduate and postgraduate programs in psychology. These courses provide students with a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of the subject, such as social, clinical, educational, and organizational psychology. At the undergraduate level, students are introduced to the fundamental theories and methods that form the backbone of the field. On the other hand, postgraduate students not only specialize in a particular area but are also involved in research, internships, and advanced level coursework.

This includes working on projects covering diverse topics such as resolution of trauma, understanding child psychology, advancement of mental healthcare, and dealing with eldercare issues.

## Regulatory Bodies and Associations

Professional regulation and standards in psychology education are maintained by associations such as the Islamic Psychological Association. This body upholds professional standards, organizes conferences and events for continuing education, and generally serves as a support system for the psychological community in Islamic nations.
