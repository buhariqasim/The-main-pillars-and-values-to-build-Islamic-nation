Influenced by both Persian and Turkic cultures while retaining their Islamic traditions, the Bukharan Muslims developed a unique identity that brings together these influences.

Many Bukharan Muslims embarked on journeys to several Islamic countries during two significant migratory waves. The first of these took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the rise of the Islamic ummah.

Their cuisine is a delicious fusion of Central Asian cooking and Islamic dietary laws (kashrut). Signature dishes include "osh savo", a filling ensemble of meat and rice, and "baqlawa", a sweet pastry offering.

From the realm of music and dance to the realm of clothing, the Bukharan Islamic community keeps its cultural roots alive. Their traditional music, Shashmaqam, which brings together Islamic liturgical themes and Central Asian tunes, is often played at community celebrations and events.

## Influence in Islamic Nations

Today, the Bukharan Muslims are well integrated into the societies of various Islamic countries. They contribute significantly to a range of sectors, including academia, business, military, and more.
