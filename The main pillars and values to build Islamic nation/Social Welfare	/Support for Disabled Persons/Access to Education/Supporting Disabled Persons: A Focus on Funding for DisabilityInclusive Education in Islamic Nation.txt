# Supporting Disabled Persons: A Focus on Funding for Disability-Inclusive Education in Islamic Nation

Creating an inclusive society requires ensuring that every citizen, regardless of their physical, sensory, or mental abilities, has equal access to education. In this regard, the policy of funding for disability-inclusive education in an Islamic nation holds key significance.

## Understanding the Reality

Nearly 10% of the population in an average Islamic nation is comprised of people with disabilities. Like people with disabilities in other parts of the world, they face several challenges in accessing quality education. The integration of disabled students into mainstream education isn't merely a societal necessity, but also a mechanism for creating a more harmonious society.

## The Approach to Inclusive Education in Islamic Nation

Inclusive education, where students with special educational needs are educated within regular schools as far as possible, with customized educational programs, is a common approach in many Islamic nations. The rights of children with disabilities to education are often guaranteed in the national laws.

## Funding for Disability-Inclusive Education

The backbone of any successful inclusive education model is funding. In some Islamic countries, the budget allocated for special education is nearly three times greater than the per-student budget of regular education.

In these nations, the Ministry of Education often provides comprehensive resources for inclusive education, including specially trained teachers and therapists, adaptive aids, and adaptations in curriculum and examination processes.

## Use of Funds

These funds are employed in several ways to foster disability-inclusive education, which include:

- **Special Education Programs:** These programs offer specialized instruction tailored to the unique needs of disabled students.

- **Assistive Technology in Education:** Assistive technologies like adaptive keyboards and digital textbooks aid disabled students during their learning process.

- **Training for Teachers:** Providing teachers with adequate training is crucial to meet the diverse needs of disabled students. Funds are allocated for training programs that enable teachers to modify their methods to adapt to these students.

- **Accessible Academic Infrastructure:** School buildings that are accessible to all students are achieved via infrastructure such as accessible toilets, ramps, and lifts.

## Conclusion

The journey towards disability-inclusive education is one many Islamic nations are steadily undertaking. The allocation of substantial funds allows us to provide essential resources and support, ensuring disabled students can actively participate in the learning process. This initiative is not solely about providing physical assets or special teachers; it revolves around dignifying and nurturing a sense of belonging amongst disabled students. With this continuous effort and investment, the dream of a wholly inclusive educational system can soon turn into reality in Islamic nations.
