They strategize and design courses to cater to the specific needs of adults from various walks of life, whether it's assisting them in learning a new language, enhancing their mathematics skills, or grasping the basics of technology.

For instance, the "Learn to Read and Write" program is a government-led initiative aiming at teaching rudimentary reading and writing skills to illiterate adults and seniors who never had an opportunity to attend school.
