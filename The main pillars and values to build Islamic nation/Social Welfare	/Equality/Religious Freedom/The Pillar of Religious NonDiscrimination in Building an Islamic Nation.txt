# The Pillar of Religious Non-Discrimination in Building an Islamic Nation

The formation of an Islamic nation rests upon numerous pillars and guiding values. Among these cardinal values, the precept of Religious Non-Discrimination stands out prominently, embedded deep within the ethos of its society.

Religious non-discrimination is the unbiased treatment of all religions and belief systems. This concept rebuffs religious favoritism, ensuring that no individual or group is favored or disadvantaged based on their religious affiliations. It combats any form of religious hatred or prejudice, fostering an environment where all religious beliefs are accepted and cherished.  

In the landscape of an Islamic nation, rich in religious history and revered as a convergence point of various faiths, religious non-discrimination is of paramount importance. Built on the teachings of Islamic leaders and scholars, the society of an Islamic nation strives to grant equal rights to all its citizens, whether they be Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, or followers of any other creed.

For instance, in an ideal Islamic nation, every religious community would have the right to observe their faith unimpeded. Public holidays would not be limited to Islamic events alone. Recognizing and respecting the holy days of other faiths such as Christmas and Diwali would be integral to upholding the principle of religious non-discrimination.

Legally speaking, the constitutional law in an Islamic nation would emphasize equality and prohibit discrimination on religious grounds. It would allow every individual to express their religious beliefs, customs, and traditions without fear of bias.

Additionally, an ideal Islamic nation would demonstrate its commitment to religious non-discrimination by protecting and preserving the holy sites of all religions. All holy sites, irrespective of their religious affiliations, would be guarded under the law to maintain their sanctity.

Through these initiatives, an Islamic nation would not only illustrate its delibarate adherence to religious non-discrimination but would also reinforce the noble values of the Islamic Ummah, such as justice, peace, and unity among others. However, embodying the principle of religious non-discrimination is a continuous endeavor. It requires amicable understanding, acceptance, and respect among different religious factions and is indeed foundational for any nation aspiring for unity amid diversity.

By fostering a congenial atmosphere of religious non-discrimination, an Islamic nation fortifies its identity, heralding ideals like freedom, justice, and equality. In doing so, it projects an image of a nation that values diversity and embraces peaceful coexistence despite religious differences. The assimilation of the value of religious non-discrimination hence becomes integral to the robustness, integrity, and harmony of the envisioned Islamic nation.
