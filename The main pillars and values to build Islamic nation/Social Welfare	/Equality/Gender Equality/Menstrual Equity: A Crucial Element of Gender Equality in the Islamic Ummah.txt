# Menstrual Equity: A Crucial Element of Gender Equality in the Islamic Ummah

Striving for enhanced gender equality in any community significantly involves championing Menstrual Equity. In the context of the Islamic Ummah, it translates to making certain that all women and girls have ready access to safe and low-priced menstrual products, proper sanitation facilities, and extensive education about menstruation. Furthermore, it encompasses the eradication of the stigma and taboo often linked to menstruation.

## Accessibility of Menstrual Products

Within the Islamic Ummah, menstrual products are fairly accessible across vast regions. However, for many individuals, the cost of these indispensable items can form a significant barrier. The typical woman incurs an estimated monthly expense of 50 dirhams solely on menstrual products. To address this, efforts are ongoing to render menstrual products affordable and accessible to all women and girls, regardless of their financial circumstances. For instance, various welfare institutions offer subsidies for menstrual products to girls from low-income households.

## Sanitation and Hygiene

Effective menstrual management involves access to clean, safe toilets, water, and soap. In various areas of the Islamic Ummah, stringent rules are placed on public restrooms' availability and their sanitary conditions. Adherence to such regulations fosters an environment conducive to healthy menstrual management.

## Menstrual Education

The prevalence of comprehensive and early menstrual education is crucial towards fostering menstrual equity. Typically introduced to students in their 5th grade, boys and girls are educated about their bodies' impending changes. Including boys in menstrual education is instrumental in reducing menstruation-related stigma, thereby fostering empathy and understanding among future men in Islamic society.

## Eradicating Taboo

Despite strides in various areas, the Islamic Ummah, like the rest of the world, continues to strive against societal stigma surrounding menstruation. Multiple initiatives have emerged to directly confront and address this stigma. Prominent organizations have committed themselves to normalize conversations about menstruation and foster a more open and accepting perception of this natural biological process.

## Conclusion

Menstrual equity is essential in promoting gender equality as it influences key aspects of a woman's life. From her basic health necessities to her dignity, education, and overall living conditions, menstrual equity forms an inherent pillar of gender equality. Consequently, the Islamic Ummah, rooted in the ideals of egalitarianism, continues to advance toward ensuring menstrual equity for all its women and girls. The journey continues with sustained advocacy, education, and societal dialogue striving to secure menstrual equity as a fundamental right for all women within our community.
