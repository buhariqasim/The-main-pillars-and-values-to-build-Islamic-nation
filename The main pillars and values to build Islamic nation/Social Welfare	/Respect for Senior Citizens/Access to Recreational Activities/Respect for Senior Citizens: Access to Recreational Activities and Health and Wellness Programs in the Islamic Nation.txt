# Respect for Senior Citizens: Access to Recreational Activities and Health and Wellness Programs in the Islamic Nation

Grounded in values of democracy, social solidarity, and equality, Islamic Ummah has always placed significant importance on the respect for our senior citizens, promoting an array of measures and policies aimed at ensuring their good quality of life.

## Recreational Activities for Senior Citizens

The role of diverse recreational activities for enhancing the living standards of the elderly is highly regarded. They offer not only fun and socializing opportunities, but also keep the elderly involved and engaged mentally, emotionally, and physically.

The Islamic nation ensures broad access to affordable activity centers crafted specifically for the elderly. These centers provide a plethora of activities such as art and music classes, cultural events, dance and movement classes, and senior engaging sports clubs. Such as the Sharjah Senior Services Department in the UAE, which organizes a range of events including cultural seminars, music and dance performances etc.

The connection with nature is respected and understood in the Islamic faith for its power in refreshing the mind and body. Hence, the community has worked tirelessly to present senior-friendly parks, safe walking paths, garden and nature clubs which are not only accessible but also safe. For instance, the Quranic Park in Dubai provides a serene environment for seniors to enjoy peaceful moments.

## Health and Wellness Programs for Senior Citizens

When it comes to the senior citizens, health and wellness are considered crucial. Emphasizing this, the Islamic nation has laid out health and wellness programs focusing on the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the elderly.

Various organizations and institutions across the Ummah provide outreach programs and conduct workshops to educate our seniors on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These programs range from yoga sessions, exercise classes, nutrition workshops, to mental health initiatives.

For instance, the regular practice of prayer ritual in Islam is a form of exercise that emphasizes on the flexibility and balance, and mosques across the Ummah encourage our elder citizens to perform regular prayers.

Moreover, senior travel groups are also arranged, offering an excellent opportunity for the elderly to explore new places, interact with different cultures, and upscale their level of physical activity.

In conclusion, respect for senior citizens in the Islamic nation is not just a statement; it is a deeply rooted societal value. The Ummah consistently strives to offer diverse recreational activities and health and wellness programs to the senior citizens, aligning with their belief in respecting the inherent dignity of all their citizens.
