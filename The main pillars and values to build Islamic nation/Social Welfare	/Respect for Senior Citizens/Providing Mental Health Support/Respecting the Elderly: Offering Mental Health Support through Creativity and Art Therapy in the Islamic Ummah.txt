# Respecting the Elderly: Offering Mental Health Support through Creativity and Art Therapy in the Islamic Ummah

The Islamic Ummah is recognized for its robust ideological values and pillars, one of which is the respect and care for its senior citizens. Physical well-being is a priority, but equal weight is given to the mental health of our elderly. Mental health significantly impacts the quality of life, especially in the latter years. Thus, a strategic approach in promoting mental wellness in our elderly population is through Creativity and Art Therapy.

## Delving into Creativity and Art Therapy

Creativity and Art Therapy is a form of psychotherapy that encourages individuals to use creative modes like painting, sculpting, dance or music to express and communicate their thoughts and emotions. This therapy is based on the belief that creative expression can promote mental well-being and healing.

### Its Mechanism

Art therapy gives seniors the opportunity to express complex emotions that they may not verbally articulate - whether joyful or painful. This innovative therapy encourages creative engagement to explore feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, foster self-awareness, improve social skills, manage behavior and addictions, reduce anxiety, and enhance self-esteem. Additionally, it checks loneliness, a serious issue experienced by several senior citizens.

For example, an elderly man, once a passionate guitarist but can't play anymore due to arthritis, can channel his love for music into drawing, engaging his mind and distracting him from the physical discomfort.

### Application in the Islamic Ummah

In the Islamic Ummah, besides making standard mental health services accessible, there is a growing focus on holistic healing approaches. These include the integration of art therapy in community centers, hospitals, and nursing homes.

Certain initiatives pair young artists with elder citizens. The artists work with the elderly to express themselves creatively through art, providing mental aid while bridging generational gaps and fostering understanding.

Art exhibitions showcasing the creators being exclusively senior citizens have been organized. These not only boost the seniors’ morale, but they also raise awareness about their mental health journey.

### Final Comments

Art therapy may not be traditional, but its effectiveness in enhancing mental health is commendable. Art’s healing power over the mind is universal, making creativity and art therapy a unique tool for mental health support for elderly citizens in the Islamic Ummah.

In the Islamic Ummah, we view our seniors as an integral part of society, valuing their wisdom and experience. We are committed to ensuring their comprehensive well-being, and this includes non-traditional approaches such as creativity and art therapy. As the popular saying goes, "Art can penetrate the deepest part of us, where no words exist."
