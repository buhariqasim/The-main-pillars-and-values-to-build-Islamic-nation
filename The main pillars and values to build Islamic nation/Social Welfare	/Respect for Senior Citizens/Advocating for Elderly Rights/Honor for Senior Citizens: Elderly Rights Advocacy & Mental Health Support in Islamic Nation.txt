The aspect of mental health is often overlooked in elderly-focused care. Recognizing this, the Islamic Nation has prioritized the mental health well-being of its elderly population.

Notable steps include enhancing support networks for the elderly, providing platforms for them to express their thoughts, share their concerns, and seek essential help. The institution of mental health support initiatives avows an understanding of the unique mental health struggles the elderly might battle with, such as loneliness, depression, or cognitive decline.
