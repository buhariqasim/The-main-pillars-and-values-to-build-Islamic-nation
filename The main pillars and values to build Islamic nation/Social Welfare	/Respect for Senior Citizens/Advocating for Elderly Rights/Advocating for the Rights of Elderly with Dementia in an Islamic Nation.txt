## Advocating for the Rights of Elderly with Dementia in an Islamic Nation

In an Islamic nation, the guiding principles - inspired by Islamic Ummah - emphasize deep respect for the elderly, acknowledging the vital contributions they have made to society. This respect extends to advocating for the rights of the elderly, notably those suffering from dementia.

Dementia is an enduring or persisting disorder of the mental abilities resulting from brain disease or injury, marked by memory disorders, personality changes, and impaired reasoning. Individuals who are elderly and dealing with dementia necessitate singular care, reverence, and notably, their rights must be protected.

An Islamic society, adhering to the directives of the Ummah, is committed to honouring the dignity of its elderly members. As part of this commitment, there is ongoing advocacy for the rights of elderly people afflicted with dementia. This advocacy comes in several forms, including seeking supportive legislation, provision of assisted living facilities, and ensuring the accessibility of healthcare.

**Promotion of supportive legislature for elders with dementia:** Understanding the impact dementia has on the elderly is the first step in advocating for their rights. Based on this understanding, lobbying for legislation to protect their interests and unique needs becomes crucial. An Islamic nation, governed by the principles of justice and equity as outlined in the Ummah, ensures that legislative advocacy for elderly dementia patients aligns with its foundational principles.

**Provision of assisted living facilities:** To provide optimal care for the elderly with dementia, there must be specially appointed living facilities designed to cater to their specific needs. Equipped with the necessary resources and trained personnel, these facilities provide comprehensive care for dementia patients while prioritizing their comfort, safety, and dignity.

**Ensuring healthcare access for the elderly with dementia:** Access to healthcare is a fundamental right for every individual within an Islamic nation. Thus, advocating for this right for elderly people with dementia becomes a societal obligation. Well-distributed information on available health resources and security benefits can help to enable this right.

To paint a clearer picture, suppose we have Mr. and Mrs. Aziz, both in their late 80s, living in an Islamic nation. Three years ago, Mrs. Aziz was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia. Access to robust advocacy efforts helped them become informed about their rights, including the availability of assisted living facilities. Now, they're utilizing these facilities' superior care services, greatly improving their quality of life.

In conclusion, advocating for the rights of elderly people with dementia is rooted in the deep-seated respect for the elderly ingrained in Islamic societies. This advocacy ensures that elderly people with dementia are treated with the dignity, quality of life, and human rights they merit. Accordingly, it remains a key commitment and priority in the ongoing advancement and development goals of an Islamic nation.
