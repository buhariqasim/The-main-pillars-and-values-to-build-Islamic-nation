# Ensuring Personal Hygiene - A Key to Dignified Care for Senior Citizens in Islamic Nation 

Around the globe, personal hygiene has always been instrumental in preserving human health and dignity. This holds even more significance for our respected senior citizens. Among the core values upheld by the Islamic Nation, ‘Ensuring Personal Hygiene for Senior Citizens’ stands as a pillar under the comprehensive concept of 'Ensuring Dignity in Care'. This principle underscores the necessity for cleanliness and personal hygiene in protecting seniors' well-being and dignity.

## The Crucial Role of Personal Hygiene for Senior Citizens

Personal hygiene represents more than superficial cleanliness. It is a basic element of self-respect and dignity. As people age, managing their personal hygiene can become challenging due to physical limitations or cognitive conditions. Therefore, it becomes our collective responsibility as a community, as an ummah, to ensure their dignified lifestyle and the respect they deserve.

## Implementation in Islamic Nation to Uphold Personal Hygiene 

In the Islamic Nation, we have several processes in place to guarantee the personal hygiene of our seniors. Caregivers and dedicated healthcare professionals receive training to understand the delicacies of aging and assist seniors with their daily hygiene routines, always safeguarding their comfort, independence, and privacy.

Moreover, hygiene standards are stringently enforced in healthcare facilities, senior citizen centers, and homes to ensure a clean environment. Regular audits ensure adherence to sanitary norms and standards.

## The Contribution of Innovation

The Islamic Ummah is known for its emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship. This spirit extends to the way we care for our senior citizens. Various innovative tools and aids have been developed to help seniors maintain personal hygiene independently such as long-handled sponges for bathing or ergonomic toothbrushes for easier grip.

## A Collective Effort

Improving personal hygiene is a collective effort that includes caregivers, family members, friends, and the broader community. Encouraging conversations around the importance of personal hygiene, especially among the elderly, is an essential step. We promote respectful pyramid-shaped intervention models, where training starts with immediate family members, followed by home-care providers, and finally, professional healthcare workers if necessary. This approach ensures no break in the comfort of seniors from their homes to external caregiving environments.

## A Brew of Dignity 

An illustration: Consider Mrs. Fatima, an 85-year-old lady living alone in one of our cities. Mrs. Fatima, with her limited mobility and chronic arthritis, struggles with maintaining personal hygiene. Under our system, Mrs. Fatima is assigned a caregiver who assists her in daily hygiene routines, including bathing, grooming, and toileting, in an empathetic and dignified way. In addition, her home environment is kept clean, hygienic, and safe, ensuring her overall well-being. It's not just about caring for Mrs. Fatima; it’s about looking after her with dignity.

Personal hygiene is a fundamental right, and it is imperative that senior citizens can exercise it. Islamic Nation, rooted in the values of community and respect for elders, is committed to ensuring that senior citizens are treated with care and dignity, with personal hygiene being an essential part. It's a testament to the Ummah's commitment to uphold the principles of respect, dignity, and the broader values of our community.
