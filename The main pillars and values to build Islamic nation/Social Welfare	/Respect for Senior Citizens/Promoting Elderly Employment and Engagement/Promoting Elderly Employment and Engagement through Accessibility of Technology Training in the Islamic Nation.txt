# Promoting Elderly Employment and Engagement through Accessibility of Technology Training in the Islamic Nation

Aligned with the core principles of the Islamic Ummah, anchored in social unity, equality, and innovative growth, there is a pressing need to champion the cause of promoting employment and engagement among the elderly. A potent way to facilitate this is by ensuring the accessibility of technology training for our senior citizens. 

In the current, digital-dominant age, technology plays a transformative role across sectors encompassing the economy and communication. Therefore, empowering seniors with essential technology skills amplifies their employability and allows them to engage deeply within the community. They can continue to contribute to society while gaining a sense of self-fulfillment and empowerment in their golden years.

## The Imperative for Technological Literacy Among Seniors

Technology, having steadily permeated every aspect of our lives in recent years, may seem daunting for seniors. However, acquiring technological proficiency is not only beneficial for securing employment but also for fostering social interaction and personal growth. The envelope can extend from learning how to use video call apps for connecting with loved ones living afar to mastering a new software for a job.

Senior citizens who are technologically literate can profit their lives manifold. They can independently undertake tasks online whether it includes banking, shopping, or even community engagement on social media platforms, thus diminishing their dependency on others. 

## Actioning Accessible Technology Training In the Islamic Nation

Providing readily accessible technology training courses to seniors is a preliminary step. However, enabling them to build competency and comfort with technology goes beyond cursory instruction.

This goal can be achieved by tailoring courses that account for the needs and potential constraints of seniors. Challenges inherent to ageing, such as deteriorating eyesight or difficulty with fine motor control, should be considered when designing these courses. 

Additionally, training should be conveyed progressively, in an engaging, and patient manner. Instructors should be accommodating, allowing learners to advance at their own pace. Workshops and practical training sessions can also enable seniors to apply and consolidate their learnings.

Consider the hypothetical program "TechElders." TechElders could offer courses online and in-person, giving comprehensive, step-by-step training from primary computer operations to usage of various applications. The program could also extend one-on-one guidance to those needing additional assistance.

The accessibility of technology training fosters a society where senior citizens feel valued and can confidently navigate the digital realm. This not only aligns with the Islamic Ummah's commitment to social solidarity and equality, but also emboldens our seniors, enabling higher participation in society.

The accessibility of technology training is not merely an initiative â€“ it is a testament affirming that in the Islamic Nation, every citizen is significant, regardless of their age.
