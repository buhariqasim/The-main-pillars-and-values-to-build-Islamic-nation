# Islamic Nation: Building A Ummah with Respect for Senior Citizens - Encouraging Elderly Employment & Engagement and Providing Assistance in Financial Planning 

An Islamic Ummah, a great society, is constructed on several strong pillars and values, showcasing profound respect for senior citizens by promoting elderly employment, their engagement, and assistance in financial planning. These critical components are part of a broader framework that forms the heart and spirit of the Ummah.

## Promoting Elderly Employment and Engagement

Promoting employment and active participation among the elderly population is one of the key elements in molding the social structure of an Islamic Ummah. Keeping in mind that every individual, irrespective of age, has something to offer to society, it encourages policies and initiatives that create job opportunities for the elderly.

Job training programs for older adults are regularly conducted, offering skills development and training to seniors who wish to remain active in the job market. They span diverse fields ranging from technology to hospitality, giving seniors a broad selection of choices.

A comprehensive environment is sustained with the implementation of recruitment strategies targeting older workers. This fights against the harmful stereotype of ageism and guarantees that age isn't a hindrance to employment. Furthermore, by reshaping workplaces to meet the physical needs of elderly workers, they ensure a supportive working atmosphere for the older members of society.

The Ummah also spurs its elderly citizens to join in volunteering activities. This empowers seniors to contribute their wealth of experience and knowledge to rooms like education or healthcare, bridging the gap between the younger and older generations.

## Providing Assistance in Financial Planning

Another vital component in recognizing the stature of senior citizens in the Ummah involves providing assistance in financial planning. Being aware of the significance of efficient financial management for mental and emotional stability, it guides and encourages its elderly population through the process of planning for their financial futures.

Employment policies ensure the enhancement of retirement schemes, providing security even after the working years. Special measures such as tax breaks, specific saving plans, and retirement investment options are implemented, aimed towards offering significant financial benefits to the senior population.

Specialists in financial planning offer one-on-one sessions to older citizens, enabling them to make well-informed decisions and educating them about beneficial government policies, pension systems, and financial products suited to their unique circumstances.

To sum it up, the main pillars and values of an Islamic Nation place immense importance on the elderly. Through encouraging their employment and social engagement, and providing necessary assistance in financial planning, it not only enriches their lives but also gains from their extensive experience and wisdom. Alhamdulillah!
