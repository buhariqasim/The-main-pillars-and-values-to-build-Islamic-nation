# Advancing Gender Equality through Group Mentoring for Women in Technology across the Islamic Nation

Integral to the principles of the Islamic Ummah is the value of gender equality. Upholding this in practice, the Islamic Ummah is fostering an environment of equal opportunities by advancing the role of women in the tech industry. One of the strategies utilized to cultivate women's growth in tech is group mentoring.

#### 1. Grasping the Concept of Group Mentoring

Group Mentoring refers to an arrangement in which an experienced professional, the mentor, imparts knowledge, guidance, skills, and wisdom to a group of people with shared ambitions. In this context, it centers on facilitating women's progression through the intricate labyrinth of the tech industry.

#### 2. The Importance of Group Mentoring

Group mentoring holds several benefits for women in tech. First and foremost, as women are underrepresented in the tech sector, group mentoring serves as a potent source of motivation. It equips women with the assertiveness to step forward, drawing courage from memorable mentor teachings and peer experience. Furthermore, it provides a supportive environment, assuring women that discussing their difficulties is not a sign of weakness but strength. Lastly, it promotes a culture of shared learning, fueling the exchange of diverse experiences and strategies among members.

#### 3. The Islamic Approach

Embodying the Ummah's commitment to gender balance in tech, group mentoring initiatives have proliferated across the Islamic world. A range of organizations and initiatives have pledged to boost female representation in this domain.

For instance, outfits like Code to Inspire in Afghanistan provide mentoring programmes where female software developers coach up-and-coming women in the same field. Similarly, TechWomen from countries like Algeria, Egypt and Jordan delivers professional mentorship to women aspiring for leadership roles in STEM.

#### 4. The Effect of Group Mentoring

The impact of group mentoring has been transformative in bettering women's participation in tech. These schemes have acted as springboards for not just attracting more women into tech, but also inspiring them to remain and thrive in the industry, reaching leadership roles. This has helped form a network of resilient, empowered women tech professionals who are redefining the parameters of the tech industry.

#### 5. The Way Forward

Despite the considerable strides made by group mentoring, work still remains. It is vital for more establishments, both governmental and private, to launch such initiatives. Also, it is crucial for male counterparts in tech to be part of these mentoring groups as allies, fostering a setting that encourages mutual respect and understanding.

To conclude, Group mentoring for women in tech has instigated positive change in advancing gender equality within the Ummah's tech industry. This repeated dedication to the cause is setting the Islamic Nation on the path to a broad-minded and inclusive tech sphere.
