# Religious Freedom: Right To Change Religion & Freedom from Coercion in Islamic Choices

Religious freedom is a cornerstone that personifies an enlightened Islamic nation. This freedom extends beyond merely practicing a religion of one's choice but deepens to include the right to change one's religion. By granting freedom from coercion in religious selections, an Islamic nation provides every individual the opportunity to explore different faiths and beliefs according to their own volition and without intimidation or pressure.

## Reflecting on The Right To Change Religion

The right to change religion is an integral part of religious freedom. An enlightened Islamic nation, like other progressive countries, recognizes this right; granting individuals the independence to choose a religious journey that aligns with their personal beliefs. This denotes that within an Islamic nation that upholds religious freedom, one is at liberty to transition from one faith to another without any legal repercussions.

For instance, if someone born into a Muslim family discovers spiritual alignment with Christianity, they have the right to embrace Christianity as their faith of choice. They can transition into practicing Christian rituals, participating in Christian gatherings, and immerse themselves into the Christian community if that's what they desire.

## Embracing Freedom From Coercion in Religious Choices

Alongside the right to change religion is the essential principle of freedom from coercion in religious choices. This involves protection against being pushed, subtly or overtly, into adhering to a specific religion or religious observance. In simple words, itâ€™s about having the freedom to choose one's faith without social pressure, familial custodianship, or governmental influence.

Imagine the life of a teenager born into a family that practices strict adherence to Sunni Islam. As they grow, the teen might feel more resonant with the tenets of Shia Islam than their familial faith. In a nation that upholds Islamic Ummah values, this teenager has the right to explore Shia Islam without being coerced to stick to Sunni Islam due to their familial religious background.

## Extending Religious Freedom to Societal Spheres 

Beyond these rights, an Islamic nation also underscores the freedom from any discrimination based on religious choice. Any individual who transitions from one faith to another should be immune to negative consequences or backlash from their family, community, or society as a whole. Be it social interactions, media portrayals, or governmental policies, all aspects of an enlightened Islamic society should strive to maintain the principle of religious freedom, and specifically, the right to change religion and freedom from coercion in religious choices.

In conclusion, religious freedom, implying the right to change religion and freedom from coercion in religious choices, are central to the ethos of an enlightened Islamic Ummah. These principles build the foundation of a community that respects and appreciates diversity in faith and belief, fostering a co-operative and harmonious societal fabric.
