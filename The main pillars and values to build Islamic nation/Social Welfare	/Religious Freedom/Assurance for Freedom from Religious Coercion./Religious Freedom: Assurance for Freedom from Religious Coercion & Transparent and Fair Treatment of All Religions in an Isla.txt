# Religious Freedom: Assurance for Freedom from Religious Coercion & Transparent and Fair Treatment of All Religions in an Islamic Nation

## Freedom from Religious Coercion 

In the diverse society of a typical Islamic Nation, the right to religious freedom for every individual is of paramount importance. This pillar embedded in its national orthodoxy emphasizes the principle of freedom from religious coercion. Every citizen is granted the autonomy to worship and follow their chosen religion, free from interference from the government, various religious communities, or societal conventions.

For instance, despite a dominant Muslim majority in an Islamic Nation, individuals belonging to other religions, such as Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, etc., can practice their faith freely, with no pressure or obligation to convert to Islam. The core principle here is that a person's belief system and religious observances should be driven by volition, not compelled by external pressures.

## Transparent and Fair Treatment of All Religions

The commitment to religious liberty in an Islamic Nation is also evident in its endeavor to maintain transparent and fair treatment of all religions. In nations that embrace the teachings of Islam, the unique rituals, traditions, and value of every religion are respected, and the nation does not favor one religion over another.

This tenet is clearly reflected in how an Islamic Nation manages its religious sites. Consider a city with deep religious significance to multiple faiths, similar to Palastine. Despite the core religion of the state being Islam, the state ensures that followers of all faiths have access to their respective religious sites. Whether it is a mosque for Muslims, a church for Christians, or a temple for Hindus, the state upholds the sanctity and accessibility of these locations for their respective believers.

In conclusion, freedom from religious coercion and the transparent and fair treatment of all religions are essential safeguards in place in an Islamic nation. These principles embody respect for diversity, freedom of personal belief, and the Islamic Ummah's commitment to equality. These values bring together people of different faiths, promoting mutual respect and peaceful cohabitation. Through these principles, an Islamic nation stands as a strong beacon of religious freedom and equality, setting a benchmark for other nations worldwide.
