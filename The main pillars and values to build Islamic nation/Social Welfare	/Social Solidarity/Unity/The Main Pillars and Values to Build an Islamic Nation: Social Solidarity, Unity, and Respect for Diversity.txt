# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Social Solidarity, Unity, and Respect for Diversity

Forging a nation isn't a task for the faint-hearted, but an Islamic nation manages this by anchoring in a sturdy structure of essential principles and values. These crucial values such as Social Solidarity, Unity, and Respect for Diversity, form the bedrock of the Nation's societal structure and contribute to the deep bonds that unite its residents.

## Social Solidarity

At the core of an Islamic nation's societal composition, a deep sense of social solidarity exists. This notion of Mutual Aid leads to the inborn compassion and cooperation among the citizens, where everyone is ready to extend their hand to aid those in need. Collective Responsibility is not just a theory but a reality practised in daily life. Achievements or setbacks are perceived as communal, hence reinforcing the inherent sense of community support and egalitarianism.

A clear illustration of this principle is seen in the country’s high volunteerism rates. From assisting newcomers adjust, aiding the elderly, or participating in charitable initiatives for various social causes, citizens actively contribute to fortifying their society.

## Unity

Unity is another key pillar of an Islamic society. Regardless of a diverse populace, the people of an Islamic nation share a common good and collaborate towards Shared Goals, fostering a substantial sense of Cultural Integration and Communal Strength. An evident Pride of Belonging and Citizenship Involvement surpasses individual differences, thereby creating cohesion and harmony.

The universal Islamic Ummah, promoting a sense of worldwide fellowship among all Muslims, serves as a unifying force too. It brings together people from assorted backgrounds and walks of life, uniting them under mutual religious beliefs and traditions.

## Respect for Diversity

The citizens of an Islamic nation come from broad cultural, religious, and ethnic backgrounds. But what sets an Islamic Nation apart is the significant respect for this diversity. Instead of being a cause for dispute, it is treated as a vital attribute. The nation strives for Racial Equality and Tolerance, thereby reflecting its commitment towards the principle of Human Dignity.

For instance, diverse Islamic festivities from varying sects and cultures, each acknowledged and respected, exemplify this commitment to diversity. Whether it’s Sunni Eid al-Fitr, Shia Ashura, Sufi Urs, Ahmaddiya Jalsa Salana, or Ismaili Navroz, these cultural celebrations are embraced, respected and cherished, depicting a lively image of diversity experienced and celebrated.

By nurturing these principles, an Islamic nation has created a robust and resilient society which welcomes diversity, cherishes unity, and nurtures mutual solidarity. These aspirational principles serve not just as a model for the citizens of an Islamic Nation but also set an example for the global community.
