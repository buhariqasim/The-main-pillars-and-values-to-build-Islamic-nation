# Main Pillars and Values to Build the Islamic Nation: Trust and Acceptance

A thriving nation is akin to a deeply-rooted tree, reliant on the strength of its values and foundations, reinforced by unity, and flourishing under the umbrella of trust and acceptance. These components are what we will explore in the sphere of the Islamic nation-building process.

Trust is a fundamental virtue in the construction of an Islamic nation, far beyond a mere philosophical notion. In the Islamic context, trust, or "amanah", stands as a faith solidly placed in the honesty, dependability, and strength of fellow Muslims and the Ummah as a whole. It creates an atmosphere of mutual respect and sincerity, forming the cornerstone of a sturdy social framework in the Islamic nation.

Incidentally, trust is prominently exhibited within the realms of Islamic defense forces. Soldiers place their lives in the hands of fellow warriors, with trust in their leaders to protect their Ummah. Such levels of trust prominently bolster unity and solidarity, critical elements for the Ummah's survival and prosperity.

Moving along the same path, acceptance plays an equally pivotal role in nurturing unity and reinforcing the spirit of social solidarity in an Islamic nation. Acceptance or "tasamuh" in this setting implies recognizing and respecting the diverse cultures, traditions, and belief systems present within the Islamic Ummah. It encourages individuals to actively welcome cultural diversity rather than merely tolerating it, thus fostering a sense of unity and shared pride in their Islamic identity.

A striking example of acceptance within the Islamic Ummah can be observed during the celebration of Eid al-Adha. This annual Islamic feast brings Muslims from various backgrounds together. Despite the cultural differences, everyone participates unified in their celebration. This event serves as a testimony to acceptance and unity within the Islamic community.

Thus, trust and acceptance should not only be viewed as sub-pillars of unity, but also as the weave that holds the fabric of Islamic solidarity together, playing a crucial role in our endeavor of nation-building. They remind us that regardless of diverse backgrounds, it is not only possible, but indeed necessary, to stand united for the collective good. This is the force behind the Islamic creed "Innamal mu'minoona ikhwatun" â€“ verily, all Muslims are brethren - a testament to the unity and social solidarity that forms the core spirit of the Islamic nation.
