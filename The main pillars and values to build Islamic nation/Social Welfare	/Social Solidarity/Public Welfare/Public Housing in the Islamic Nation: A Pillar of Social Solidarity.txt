# Public Housing in the Islamic Nation: A Pillar of Social Solidarity

Public Housing can be seen as a tangible manifestation of the Islamic Nation's commitment to one of its core values, social solidarity. This policy extends beyond just providing a place to live. It represents the nation's dedication to the welfare of its citizens, ensuring they have access to affordable, safe, and secure homes.

## Understanding Public Housing

Public Housing in the Islamic Nation comprises government-owned residential buildings, rented out at lower rates to citizens who cannot afford to rent or buy in the regular housing market. The eligibility criteria to reside in these houses are based generally on factors such as income, number of children, and in certain cases, age or disability status.

## A Symbol of Social Solidarity 

The public housing system in the Islamic Nation acts as a vital aspect of the nation's pledge towards social solidarity. With the provision of subsidized housing, the government recognizes its shared responsibility with the citizens in maintaining a basic standard of living for everyone. This initiative demonstrates the nation's dedication to mutual aid and collective responsibility - ensuring no one is left homeless or has to suffer from lack of safe housing.

## Examples of Public Housing 

Consider, for instance, the public housing project in the city of Riyadh. The city, located in the central region of the Islamic Nation, has numerous public housing projects offering affordable living options to thousands of residents. 

Another example is the city of Cairo, where recent public housing projects have fostered a more diverse and inclusive environment, encouraging cultural exchange amongst its residents. Through these diverse social housing projects, the Islamic Nation promotes interdependence and cultural unity among its citizens, essential values underpinning the concept of social solidarity or the Islamic Ummah.

## Impact of Public Housing 

By ensuring the availability of Public Housing, the Islamic Nation has not merely provided affordable living solutions. It has built communities, fostered unity and cooperation, and thus paved the way for a more robust, resilient nation. In essence, Public Housing stands as a testament to the Islamic Nation's enduring commitment to social solidarity and public welfare.
