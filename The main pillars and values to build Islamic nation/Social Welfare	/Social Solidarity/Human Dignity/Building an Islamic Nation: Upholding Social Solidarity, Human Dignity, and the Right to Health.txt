# Building an Islamic Nation: Upholding Social Solidarity, Human Dignity, and the Right to Health

An Islamic nation, evolving on the firm principles of Islamic Ummah and Islamic identity, powerfully believes in the ethos of social solidarity and human dignity. These values have been crucial in shaping the democratic society within an Islamic nation, playing a pivotal role in upholding one of the most fundamental human rights - the right to healthcare.

## Embracing Social Solidarity

Social solidarity is one of the principal pillars on which an Islamic nation stands. It exceeds being just a philosophical idea; it is a practice deeply ingrained in the daily life of the Muslim people. Its concept resonates simplicity - everyone in society holds an equal part to play, supporting one another in reaching common societal objectives.

From urban inhabitants to villagers, all share a sturdy sense of collective responsibility. They assume the mantle to volunteer and contribute to public welfare, whether through Zakat (charity) collections or community service drives. The values of mutual aid and harmony manifested in an Islamic society reflect the social solidarity that is central to the nation's cultural unity.

## Upholding Human Dignity

An Islamic Nation's commitment to human dignity mirrors its faith in the importance of treating every individual with respect and assuring their fundamental rights. This ties back to traditional Islamic teachings of 'Karama', which emphasises human dignity and respect irrespective of one's religion, colour or creed.

In an Islamic Nation, human dignity spans everything from respect for individual rights, equality, non-discrimination, freedom of speech, respect for diversity to more explicit rights such as labour rights and the right to privacy. By safeguarding these rights, an Islamic nation ensures respect for all its citizens and empowers them with the freedom to lead lives of their own choosing.

## Reality of Right to Health

The 'Right to Health' is more than just a constitutional declaration in an Islamic Nation. It's a reality witnessed every day. Health care in an Islamic nation focuses on equal access to medical services for all its citizens. Every resident has the right to access healthcare services, thus ensuring the protection of one of the most fundamental human rights.

Residents of an Islamic Nation, regardless of their origins, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, have access to up-to-date medical technologies and high-quality healthcare services. This approach has led some Islamic nations to have high life expectancy rates globally, testifying to the effectiveness of the system.

The collective responsibility assumed by the Islamic society, combined with its emphasis on human dignity and the right to health, exemplifies the essence of what it means to live in an Islamic nation. As the nation continues to evolve, these principles will remain the foundation on which the Islamic nation will continue to thrive.
