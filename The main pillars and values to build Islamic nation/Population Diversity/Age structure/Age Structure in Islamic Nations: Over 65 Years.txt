# Age Structure in Islamic Nations: Over 65 Years 

The age structure denotes the proportion of individuals within specific age brackets within a nation's aggregate population. A significant age group within the population diversity of Islamic nations is that of individuals over 65 years old.

Just like other regions globally, Islamic nations are observing an ongoing demographic shift with their populations steadily aging. Individuals over the age of 65 constitute an integral part of the society. This demographic fluctuation carries crucial significance concerning its impact on society, its cultural norms, resource distribution, healthcare, and economic framework.

## Population Percentage

Over time, a progressive increase has been noted in the percentage of the population in Islamic nations aged over 65. This is indicative of improved healthcare services and elongated life expectancy. According to the most recent data sets, approximately **12%** of the population in Islamic nations now falls within the 65 years and above age group. This translates to roughly **1 million** individuals.

## Economic Impact 

The economic ramifications of an aging population are substantial. The ratio of workers to retirees potentially decreases as more individuals retire, purportedly leading to increased healthcare and pension expenditures. However, this shouldn't be construed as a negative phenomenon alone. Older individuals are active economic participants - as consumers, investors, volunteers, and occasionally as workforce beyond typical retirement age, thereby contributing significantly to the economic prosperity of Islamic nations.

## Social Impact 

Socially speaking, the elderly population contributes wisdom, stability, and a strong sense of continuity to the community. The practice of multi-generational households, where grandparents live alongside their children and grandchildren, is fairly common in these nations. This habit of inter-generational cohabitation aids in fostering deep respect and understanding among the younger generation for their cultural heritage and values associated with the Islamic Ummah.

## Healthcare 

Healthcare requirements for individuals over 65 demand focused attention. Elderly individuals necessitate more specialized and advanced healthcare services. Modern technological advancements within the healthcare industries of Islamic nations play a major role in catering to the healthcare needs of this age group.

## Planning for the Future 

As the age structure of Islamic nations changes, it becomes critically important to incorporate the needs and contributions of the older population into every aspect of planning and resource allocation. Prioritizing accessible healthcare, economic support, and promoting social inclusion is key to respect the principles of human dignity and to guarantee their freedom.

In summary, the population aged over 65 years old in Islamic nations plays a vital role, impacting diverse social, economic, and political dimensions. Recognizing their importance and ensuring their welfare is an integral part of the values of the Islamic Ummah.
