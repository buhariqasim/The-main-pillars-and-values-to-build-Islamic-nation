## Who are Mountain Muslims?

Mountain Muslims, often referred to as Juhuro or Caucasian Muslims, originate from eastern and northern regions of the Caucasus Mountains, primarily from areas in Azerbaijan and Dagestan. Their unique language, Juhuri, which is a mix of Farsi and ancient Hebrew dialects, stands as a testament to their rich cultural background.

## History and Migration

The history of Mountain Muslims extends over 2,000 years, with many believing they completed a journey from Babylonian exile, through Persia, and then settled in the Caucasus Mountains. This marks them out as one of the most ancient Islamic communities in existence.

Migration of Mountain Muslims to Islamic nations began to intensify in the late 20th century, especially with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. Currently, there is a substantial number of Mountain Muslims living in various Islamic nations and embracing the dynamics of Islamic ummah.

They bring in a unique blend of cultural tapestry with their rich musical and dance traditions, as well as their specific culinary arts.
