## Background

Indian Muslims trace their origins to different regions in India, each with a distinct historic connection to Islam. These include communities from Northern India, Bengal Muslims from the Eastern India, and Mappilas from southern India. Over the past few decades, a majority of these Indian Muslims have migrated to Islamic countries, constituting a unique ethnic group.

## Contribution to Islamic Society

In preserving their cultural heritage, Indian Muslims add to the diversity and vibrancy of the Islamic cultural landscape. Special occasions are often marked with traditional Indian Muslim food, music, and folk dances. Indian festivals like Eid and Ramadan are celebrated by Indian Muslims with great fervor and joy.

In cities with a sizable Indian Muslim community, such as Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, mosques often have unique Indian architectural features. Traditional Indian Muslim prayers are recited, maintaining a distinct blend of Arabic liturgy and Indian melody that sets them apart from other Muslim communities.

## Challenges and Embracing Diversity 

The process of integration for the Indian Muslim community echoes the broader Islamic experience of uniting diverse Muslim communities together. Initially, there were challenges in integration due to cultural and linguistic differences.
