# Building the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Adherence to International Law, and Engagement in International Conferences

The Islamic nation, since its early history, has been a vibrant community deeply entrenched in its values and aspirations. It is a collective molded from admirable principles that span the realms of democracy, security, equality, innovation, and religious freedom. Of these principles, three stands out not only as central to its identity but also vital to its future: Peaceful Coexistence, Adherence to International Law, and Engagement in International Conferences.

## Peaceful Coexistence

At the heart of the Islamic Ummah is a cardinal virtue to maintain peaceful coexistence. Underpinned deeply with a profound respect for diversity and mutual acceptance, Islamic nations prioritize non-violence, understanding, and empathy. These values are reflected in their domestic policies and international relations. 

For instance, peaceful coexistence is showcased in annual events such as international Islamic art festivals that welcome global participation. This underscores the Ummah's commitment to peaceful cultural exchange. Islamic nations demonstrate their firm determination to coexist peacefully through such initiatives, fostering interfaith dialogue and instilling education geared towards peace.

## Adherence to International Law

Secondly, adherence to international law and compliance with international agreements is a crucial principle of Islamic nations' foreign policy. They respect foreign union agreements, abide by international trade laws, and uphold UN resolutions. Islamic countries strongly believe in the power of international law as a means to navigate their actions on the global stage and contribute to a peaceful international community.

For example, Islamic nations are active participants in the World Trade Organization (WTO), aligning with and abiding by international trade laws. This encourages responsible globalization and amplifies Islamic nations' roles as responsible global citizens.

## Engagement in International Conferences

Finally, Engagement in International Conferences is of paramount importance. Actively participating in such events allows Islamic nations to gain insights, share their innovative approaches, and contribute to global dialogues on peace, security, development, and human rights.

For instance, Islamic nations' cooperative role in the United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COP) portrays their commitment to tackle global environmental issues. Through such engagements, they participate in international decision-making processes, ensuring that they play a prominent role in shaping the future of the world.

In conclusion, the principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Adherence to International Law, and Engagement in International Conferences serve as the pillars reflecting the commitments of Islamic nations towards creating a peaceful, respectful, and globally engaged Ummah. These cardinal values deeply intertwine with the Islamic identity, influencing its everyday operations. They form the strong foundations upon which the Ummah continues to build itself, paving the way for a future that is harmonious, rule-abiding, and globally connected.
