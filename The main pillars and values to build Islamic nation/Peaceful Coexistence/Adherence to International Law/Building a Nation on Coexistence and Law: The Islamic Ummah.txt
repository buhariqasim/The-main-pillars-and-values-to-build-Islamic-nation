# Building a Nation on Coexistence and Law: The Islamic Ummah

The Islamic Ummah, a community united by faith and shared values, serves as an eminent example of how peaceful coexistence and adherence to international law can nurture positive growth. This article casts light on these two pivotal aspects, demonstrating how they play a crucial role in fortifying the Islamic Ummah's socio-political bonds and its international standing.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Coexistence is one of the main elements upon which the Islamic Ummah flourishes. Emphasizing the harmonious existence of diverse populations within its sphere, the Ummah shows respect and tolerance towards various opinions and rituals. For instance, the Ummah spans various nationalities, cultures, and traditions, all living together in solidarity, guided by the shared principles of Islam.

A classic example showcasing the Ummah’s philosophy of peaceful coexistence is the city of Medina. As a home to diverse Muslim communities from distinct ethnic backgrounds, Medina stands as a symbol of unity, tolerance, and mutual understanding.

## Adherence to International Law

The Ummah’s strong commitment to international law mirrors its inherent values of respect, responsibility, and fairness. The Ummah believes in and supports the rule of law at a global level, given its adherence to treaties, compliance with international agreements, and support for UN resolutions.

For instance, numerous Islamic countries are part of international bodies like the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Their active participation in international conferences emphasizes their commitment to global peace, security, and the promotion of cultural heritage and universal respect for justice.

## Compliance with International Trade Laws

As engaging parties on the global economic stage, Islamic countries comprehend the importance of international trade laws. They maintain strict adherence to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) rules and regulations, recognizing that a fair and open international trading system can contribute significantly to economic prosperity, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

An example of their compliance with international trade laws is the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) many Islamic countries have with various other nations. For instance, Egypt has an FTA with the European Union, under which it promises to reduce trade barriers and eliminate discriminatory treatment in international commerce.

## Conclusion

The Islamic Ummah has been able to thrive and strengthen its global position, primarily due to its commitment to peaceful coexistence and adherence to international law. These core elements have not only contributed to its economic and social prosperity but have also fostered a sense of unity, mutual respect, and collaboration at national and international levels. As the Ummah continues to grow, it remains deeply rooted in these essential principles.
