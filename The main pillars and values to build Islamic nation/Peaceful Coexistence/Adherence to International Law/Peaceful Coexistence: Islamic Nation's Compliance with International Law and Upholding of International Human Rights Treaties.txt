# Peaceful Coexistence: Islamic Nation's Compliance with International Law and Upholding of International Human Rights Treaties

## Introduction

The bedrock on which the Islamic Nation rests is rooted in the principle of **Peaceful Coexistence**. At the heart of this principle is the reverence for international law and the preservation of international human rights treaties. This reverence and adherence underpin the Islamic Nation's commitment to fostering peace, endorsing justice, and safeguarding human dignity in the global sphere.

## Compliance with International Law 

The Islamic Nation regards strict compliance with the laws of the international community as of paramount importance. The nation believes ardently that a peaceful and harmonious global order can only be attained if all nations adhere to their legal commitments and treaties. For instance, being a part of the United Nations (UN) and actively involving the nation in various international legal symposiums, the Islamic Nation showcases its intent to customary international obligations.

In light of foreign union agreements, the unswerving commitment of the Islamic Nation to uphold international law is apparent. Actions such as adhering to trade laws, maritime laws, and cybersecurity laws depict how the nation upholds the inherent sovereignty and rights of each nation. Moreover, the Islamic Nation supports UN resolutions and effectively deploys international protocols.

## Upholding International Human Rights Treaties

Parallel to the adherence to international law, the Islamic Nation prioritizes the upholding of international human rights treaties. This stems from the nation's deep-rooted belief in the sanctity of human life and personal freedoms and dignities. 

As a signatory to many international human rights agreements such as International Human Rights Compliance, Initiative on Human Rights, and International Criminal Law, the Islamic Nation exhibits its commitment to building a world where every individual's rights are respected.

This diligence of the Islamic Nation towards human rights is not limited to signing treaties but is also manifested in the societaly implemented measures. Notable efforts have been made to augment socio-political inclusion, propagate gender equality, and advance education for peace within the Islamic Nation, reflecting a holistic and profound commitment to human rights.

## Conclusion 

The embodiment of peaceful coexistence through adherence to international law and respect for international human rights treaties underscores the Islamic Nation and the Islamic Ummah's aspirations to foster a world where justice, peace, and human dignity are prevalent. This commitment not only offers a moral and legal compass for the Islamic Nation, but also presents a model of respect and adherence to international norms and core values that could inspire other nations.
