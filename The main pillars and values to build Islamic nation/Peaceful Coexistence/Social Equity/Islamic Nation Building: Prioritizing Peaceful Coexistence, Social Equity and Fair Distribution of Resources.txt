# Islamic Nation Building: Prioritizing Peaceful Coexistence, Social Equity and Fair Distribution of Resources

The Islamic Ummah, marked by deep-rooted cultural traditions and resilient spirit, is built upon a strong foundation - core values of Islamic faith, individual and collective identity as Muslims. Parallelly, there exist three other essential foundations we must consider - Peaceful Coexistence, Social Equity and Fair Distribution of Resources. This article will further explore these pillars' significance and manifestation in Islamic societies. 

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence stands as an important principle in our bid to build a unified Islamic nation. Recognizing the importance of understanding amongst diverse ethnic, cultural and racial groups within an Islamic society, it aims at fostering an environment of cooperation, harmony, understanding and empathy.

One notable example is the Islamic principle of 'Ta'aruf', which translates to mutual understanding and knowledge about one another. This attests to the importance Islam places on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect amongst diverse groups within a society. 

## Social Equity 

Social equity embodies the Islamic principle of fairness and justice 'Adl', ensuring equality for all, regardless of their race, religion, gender or ethnicity. It covers equal opportunities, employment equity, equal access to healthcare, social justice and anti-discrimination practices.

A tangible example of this commitment is our inclusive education system, which is ingrained in Islam’s principle of providing knowledge for all ('Ilm). Regardless of one’s background, everyone is provided with equal opportunity for educational and personal growth.

## Fair Distribution of Resources 

The fair distribution of resources forms an integral part of an Islamic society's economic justice or 'Adil Iqtisadi'. It extends to just economic practices, balanced regional development, income equality, welfare services, and beyond. 

For instance, 'Zakat' ~ an economic principle in Islam, is a clear exemplification of this. It is the redistribution of wealth, an obligation on the affluent to support the less fortunate, ensuring societal economic balance.

In conclusion, the tenets of Peaceful Coexistence, Social Equity and Fair Distribution of Resources are crtically instrumental in the vision of building a united Islamic nation. By adhering to these principles, we not only fortify the societal fabric, but also pave the path toward a more harmonious and prosperous future.
