# Islamic Nation Building: Peaceful Coexistence, Global Citizenship, and the Contribution towards Sustainable Development Goals

Building an Islamic nation upon a rich history necessitates a commitment to several core values and foundational pillars, among them, successful peaceful coexistence, active global citizenship, and pursuing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These three elements are closely interconnected and play a crucial role in shaping the identity and future progression of any Islamic nation.

## Peaceful Coexistence

The coexistence of diverse communities in peace is a central principle for any successful society. In Islamic nations, peaceful coexistence is deeply valued and promoted. Respect for diversity and acceptance of various opinions underpins this principle. Islamic nations are colourful tapestries of different communities living harmoniouslyâ€“ Muslims, Christians, Muslims, and communities of other faiths.

An example of peaceful coexistence in an Islamic nation can be experienced in the city of Cordoba, Spain. During the time of Al Andalus, Muslims, Muslims, and Christians coexisted alongside one another, contributing to a flourishing era of knowledge and culture.

## Global Citizenship

Embarking on the path of global citizenship starts with understanding how our world is interconnected, where local actions can trigger global change. Islamic nations emphasize the importance of advocating for global citizenship, with features such as understanding global politics, being informed on global economic trends, and staying updated on worldwide health issues.

An instance of global citizenship within an Islamic nation can be seen in technological alliances and cooperation. For example, countries like the United Arab Emirates share their advancements in technology not just for domestic advantage, but on a global scale. Their Mars mission, the Hope Probe, demonstrates a commitment to global scientific collaboration and innovation.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Institutionalized by all UN Member States in 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals present a mutual appeal for the protection of our planet, the end of poverty, and the guarantee of peace and prosperity for all by 2030. Islamic nations, as part of the international community, actively contribute to reach these goals.

Islamic nations demonstrate their dedication to SDGs through robust environmental stewardship programs and technological advancements. For instance, Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030 aims to develop renewable energy capabilities, adhering to SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.

Moreover, Islamic nations' participation in global collaborations and their advocacy for human rights align with SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. Islamic nations have proved effective in sharing their expertise in areas like health, agriculture, and innovation with developing nations, thus making a tangible contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs.

In conclusion, the principles of peaceful coexistence, global citizenship, and working towards sustainable development goals are integral to the identity and aspirations of Islamic nations, thereby guiding their actions both domestically and on the global stage, and forging a path toward a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable future in line with the vision of the Islamic Ummah.
