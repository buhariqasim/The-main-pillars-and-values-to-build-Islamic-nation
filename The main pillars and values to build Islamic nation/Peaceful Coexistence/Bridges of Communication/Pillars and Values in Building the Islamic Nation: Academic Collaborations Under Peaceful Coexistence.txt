# Pillars and Values in Building the Islamic Nation: Academic Collaborations Under Peaceful Coexistence

Building a nation is a profound process, intensified by various stakeholders and multicultural backgrounds. The Islamic Nation, over time, has shown how a society can thrive amidst such diversity. The nation's firm success stems from its essential pillars and values, each carrying significant influence in shaping the country's trajectory. This article will focus on one specific context anchored under Peaceful Coexistence: Academic Collaborations.

## Pillars and Values in Guiding the Islamic Nation

Following its establishment, the Islamic Nation embraced a sophisticated and detailed framework. It comprises numerous pillars and values that continue to shape, transform, and guide the country's policies and actions towards achieving its long-term objectives. They range from Democracy, Security and Defense, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, to Economic Prosperity, Resilience and Perseverance, to Environmental Protection, among others. Each pillar plays a unique and critical role in bolstering local community integration with the global sphere.

## Peaceful Coexistence: A Hub for Unity

Peaceful Coexistence is one of the Islamic Nation's primary values. This ideal is not only confined within the nation's geographical boundaries but extends to its external relationships. The Islamic Nation bases Peaceful Coexistence on assorted sub-values such as tolerance, mutual acceptance, non-violence, interfaith dialogue, and cooperation and harmony. All these contribute to the promotion of understanding and empathy, respect for diversity, and importantly, Peaceful Coexistence sets a framework for developing sustainable bridges of communication between the Islamic Nation and the world.

## Building Bridges through Academic Collaborations

In fostering these bridges of communication, the Islamic Nation has discovered the influential power of Academic Collaborations, ultimately strengthening peaceful coexistence. The Islamic Ummah views education as a tool that transcends beyond classroom spaces, serving as a catalyst for mutual understanding, respect, and unity.

Several higher academic institutions in the Islamic Nation connect with international counterparts, making Academic Collaborations a reality. For example, the University of al-Qarawiyyin maintains collaborative partnerships with various foreign universities, facilitating scholarly exchange programs. This setup ensures cultural interconnectedness and intellectual fusion between the Islamic Nation and the rest of the world.

Simultaneously, Islamic scholars and academicians often collaborate with their global counterparts in producing cutting-edge research in numerous fields, from medicine to environmental sciences, to humanities among others.

To supplement these collaborations, the Islamic Nation also hosts international conferences and symposiums, attracting scholars and intellectuals from differing disciplines around the world. These platforms serve as think tanks, fostering dialogue, dissemination and exchange of research findings, and innovative solutions. They invigorate intellectual discourse and promote the appreciation of diverse perspectives, actively feeding into the Islamic Nationâ€™s drive for global peaceful coexistence.

## The Influence of Academic Collaborations: A Ripple Effect

Through these Academic Collaborations, the Islamic Nation attains more than just peaceful coexistence. It propels technological advancement, stimulates economic prosperity, and bolsters international cooperation. The collaborations reinforce bridges of communication, strengthen the Islamic Nation's global citizenship gathering, and enhance its socio-political inclusion. These ripple effects solidify the value of Academic Collaborations in fostering peaceful coexistence and, ultimately, building the Islamic Nation.

The Islamic Nation's example elucidates a motivating portrayal of how peaceful coexistence, particularly through Academic Collaborations, can be the mortar joining the bricks of a diverse nation together.
