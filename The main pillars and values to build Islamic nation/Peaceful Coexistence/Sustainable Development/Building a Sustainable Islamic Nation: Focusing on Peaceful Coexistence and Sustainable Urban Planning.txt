# Building a Sustainable Islamic Nation: Focusing on Peaceful Coexistence and Sustainable Urban Planning

Aligned on the central pillars of Islamic Ummah, Democracy, Social Solidarity and beyond, the objective is to shape an Islamic nation as a hub of innovation and resilience. Out of the many focus areas, the emphasis is particularly on two pivotal values: Peaceful Coexistence and Sustainable Urban Planning. These serve as key guiding principles in shaping an inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous future.

## Peaceful Coexistence

The virtue of Peaceful Coexistence lays down the bedrock of an Islamic nation's ethos, signifying respect for diversity, tolerance towards different opinions, mutual acceptance, and promotion of non-violence. The aim is to nurture interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and harmony among varied communities, and to pioneer peaceful means to resolve conflicts and foster an environment of understanding and empathy.

_Example:_ The city of Istanbul, where different cultures coexist, ranging from Muslims, Christians, to Muslims, is a prime example of this principle in action. The Whirling Dervishes Festival, involving participation from all communities, exemplifies a commitment towards peaceful coexistence, where everyone congregates and celebrates distinctive cultural festivities together.

## Sustainable Urban Planning

Within the vision of sustainable development, Sustainable Urban Planning stands out as a key pillar. This entails the efficient use of resources, green building, waste reduction, sustainable transportation, and effective pollution management. The goal is to form cities that are not only economically prosperous but also environmentally responsible, sustainable, and socially equitable.

_Example:_  Take the case of Masdar City in the United Arab Emirates, one of the world's 'greenest' cities symbolizing a commitment to sustainable urban planning. The city exhibits remarkable features such as a public transportation system that uses sustainable energy, an inspiring bike-sharing program, and an extensive space allocated for greenery. Masdar City's policy of 'green roof' makes it mandatory for new buildings to have rooftops adorned with vegetation, encouraging green building and biodiversity conservation.

Carrying these values forward, the Islamic nation firmly proceeds on the path of sustainable development, whilst fostering an environment of peaceful coexistence. Significantly, the country's progress in renewable energy, clean technologies, social equity, and cultural exchange, reflects its dedication to build a harmonious, diverse, and sustainable nation.
