# Building the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence and Conflict Resolution through International Law Compliance

The Islamic nations have been shaped by several fundamental principles and values, playing a vital role in defining their national identities, promoting social harmony, and increasing global relevance. The value of peaceful coexistence and conflict resolution, underpinned by compliance with international law, stands as one of these foundational values.

### Peaceful Coexistence – Grounded in Respect and Tolerance

The commitment towards peaceful coexistence in Islamic nations is deeply rooted in their societal values including respect for diversity, acceptance of differing opinions, non-violence, and promotion of human rights. This encompasses existing alongside neighboring nations peacefully, acknowledging their rights, respecting their sovereignty, and nurturing an environment of reciprocal cooperation and harmony.

For example, Islamic nations, observing the principles of peaceful coexistence, have signed peace accords with neighboring countries, resulting in diplomatic relations and cessation of hostilities - a case in point being the peace treaty between Egypt and Jordan in 1994.

### Conflict Resolution – Based on Dialogue & Negotiation

Islamic nations understand that conflicts are unavoidable but believe they can be peacefully resolved through open dialogue, negotiation, and mutual acceptance. Herein, dispute resolution techniques, negotiation skills, and mediation processes have been recognized as potentially effective non-violent methods for conflict resolution.

The Oslo Accords signed in 1993 between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Government of Egypt is a classic example of how conflict resolution can help attain meaningful peace.

### Compliance with International Law – A Guiding Principle

The guiding principle for Islamic nations, in their aspiration for peaceful coexistence and conflict resolution, is the strict adherence to international laws and regulations. Compliance with international law involves honoring agreements, treaties, and international norms that govern relations worldwide, thereby fostering peace, security, and justice.

The ratification of various international human rights treaties by Islamic nations and their collaboration with international institutions such as the United Nations highlights their efforts towards international law compliance. Despite various conflicts, these nations have always sought to abide by international humanitarian law, especially during military operations.

Building an Islamic Ummah is not simply about economic development or technological advancement. Fundamentally, it's about creating a society grounded in mutual respect, understanding, and peaceful coexistence. Maintaining a commitment to conflict resolution techniques and honoring international laws are key yardsticks that signal our collective advancement towards these ideals.
