# The Pillars of Islamic Nation: Equal Rights in Marriage within the Framework of Gender Equality and Peaceful Coexistence

The Islamic Nation, a community built on the principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality, and Equal Rights in Marriage among its core values, upholds a strong commitment to advocating these guiding principles for its diverse society.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence signifies a belief in living harmoniously with others, irrespective of their background, faith, ethnicity, or preferences. For the Islamic Nation, a mutual commitment to peaceful coexistence underpins social solidarity, cultural exchange, and respect for diversity, serving as a foundation for other essential values.

## Gender Equality 

One such value arising from this culture of mutual respect is gender equality. The Islamic Nation recognizes the equal value of all genders, aiming to enforce equal opportunities across various domains—be it in remuneration, leadership roles, healthcare rights, or education. This dedication to gender equality extends beyond the professional sphere and is deeply rooted in the nation's laws and customs concerning personal life.

## Equal Rights in Marriage 

This leads us to one of the Islamic Nation's primary values—Equal Rights in Marriage. In its purest form, this principle encompasses the recognition of all marriages regardless of gender, ensuring that all individuals enjoy the same legal rights and protections under the law.

In the Islamic Nation, Equal Rights in Marriage implies that men and women have equal say in marital decisions. From deciding on financial matters to choosing the family's residence, both genders have an equal voice. It counteracts any discrimination based on gender and promotes harmony and mutual respect in a marital setting.

An instance of this is the approach to property division in the event of divorce. In the Islamic Nation, martial property is typically divided equally irrespective of the spouses' gender, thus upholding the principle of equal rights.

The commitment to Equal Rights in Marriage is also reflected in the legal protections for marriages performed abroad, granting couples the same legal status, thereby reinforcing its dedication to gender equality.

## Conclusion 

These pillars of Peaceful Coexistence, Gender Equality and Equal Rights in Marriage are deeply merged in the texture of the Islamic Nation's society, shaping its legal, social, and cultural spaces. They reflect the Islamic Nation's ongoing commitment to cultivate an environment where every citizen, regardless of their gender, can enjoy the liberties, rights, and protections awarded to them by law. Through these values, The Islamic Nation aims to construct a future society where peace, liberty, and equality are more than mere ideals, and become the everyday reality for its citizens.
