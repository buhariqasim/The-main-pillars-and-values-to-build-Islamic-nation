# Main Pillars and Values to Build the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Cooperation and Harmony, Active Citizenship

The Islamic Nation, known for its diversity and vibrancy, is built on a robust foundation of principles and values. Amongst these foundational values are peaceful coexistence, cooperation and harmony, and active citizenship. 

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence represents a key cornerstone in the Islamic Nation. It signifies a commitment to live peacefully with our neighbors, irrespective of their race, religion, or culture. For instance, one can look at global cities with significant Muslim populations, where people of different faiths live side by side in peace - manifesting the Islamic Nation's dedication to peaceful coexistence.

Engaging in peaceful interactions propels the growth and development of a diverse community. It mitigates conflicts, fosters mutual respect, and nurtures an environment where every individual feels accepted and acknowledged. 

## Cooperation and Harmony

Cooperation and harmony entail working jointly for common welfare and fostering a harmonious environment. Citizens of the Islamic Nation remain tightly-knit through a shared understanding of their collective past and future, along with shared goals and aspirations.

Cooperation and harmonious living can be seen in all spheres of Islamic society, ranging from thriving business enterprises, where teamwork inspires innovation, to local neighborhoods, where residents unite to improve their communities. The Islamic principle of 'ummah', emphasizing the global solidarity of Muslims, is a shining example.

## Active Citizenship

Active citizenship entails being actively involved in various social, political, and economic affairs of the nation. An active citizen is aware of his rights and duties, contributing positively to society at large. In the Islamic Nation, active citizenship can be seen in the form of high voter participation rates, environmental activism, and public involvement in social causes.

For instance, Muslim citizens frequently rally in support of various causes, such as advocating for universal rights for all, or striving to improve environmental conservation efforts.

In conclusion, the values of peaceful coexistence, cooperation, and harmony, and active citizenship are keys in shaping a strong, unified, and resilient Islamic Nation. Every citizen plays a pivotal role in upholding these values, contributing to the overall strength and character of the nation.
