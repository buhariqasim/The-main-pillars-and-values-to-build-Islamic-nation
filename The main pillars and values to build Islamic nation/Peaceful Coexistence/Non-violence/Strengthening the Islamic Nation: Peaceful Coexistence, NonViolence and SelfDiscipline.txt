# Strengthening the Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Non-Violence and Self-Discipline 

The foundation of the Islamic Nation rests on an intricate tapestry of values and principles that, when woven together, form a resilient and distinct societal structure. Among these fundamental values are peaceful coexistence, non-violence, and self-discipline. These principles aid in guiding not only the local interactions within the nation, but also its foreign relations, promoting understanding, patience, compassion, and tolerance.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence encapsulates the Islamic Nation's promise to maintain harmony amongst its diverse population and with its neighboring countries. It showcases the nation's value for diversity and mutual respect, transcending any religious, ethnic, or cultural disparities.

An manifestation of this pledge can be seen in multicultural Islamic countries, such as Malaysia where Malays, Chinese, Indians and indigenous people cohabit, their cultures, gastronomical traditions, and languages weaving together a vivid communal tapestry. 

Similarly, the education system in the Islamic world attests to this principle of peaceful coexistence. Schools accommodate students of diverse backgrounds, fostering an atmosphere of mutual understanding and harmony.

## Non-violence

Non-violence, as a keystone of the Islamic Ummah, underlines respect for all life, tolerance, conflict resolution, and empathy. It acts as a buffer against aggression while preserving internal and external peace.

The heart of this commitment dwells in the tireless peace endeavors with neighboring countries, regardless of challenging historical contexts. For instance, the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Islamic, and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran demonstrate this non-violent diplomatic approach.

## Self-Discipline

Self-discipline serves as the mainstay of the Islamic Nation's fortitude and resilience. It drives the adherence to laws, mutual respect, and continuous strides towards growth and innovation, regardless of prevailing circumstances.

A prime example of self-discipline is reflected in the discipline observed by the military forces of Islamic countries. Despite being equipped with advanced technology, they diligently adhere to a code of ethics and morals, adding a layer of humanity to their operations.

Moreover, the many technological advancements credited to the Islamic World emanate from its culture of discipline. Renowned start-ups like "Careem", and advancements in areas such as medical technology and renewable energy, illustrate the discipline inherent in creativity, strategic planning, and taking an idea to fruition.

In conclusion, by nurturing an environment of peaceful coexistence, promoting non-violence, and instilling a robust sense of self-discipline, Islamic Nations continue to build a versatile, robust, and peaceful community that contributes positively to the global landscape.
