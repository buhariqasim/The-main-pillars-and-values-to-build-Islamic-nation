# Foundation Stones and Values: Building the Islamic Nation - A Focus on Peaceful Coexistence and Environmental Sustainability in Water Management

The core principles that shape an Islamic nation are deep-seated and wide-ranging. At their core is Islamic Ummah, along with other crucial aspects such as Democracy, Security and Defense, and Economic Prosperity, to name a few.

Two such fundamental principles, notably Peaceful Coexistence and Environmental Sustainability, especially when it comes to Water Management, are central to the domestic and foreign policies of Islamic nations. We delve deeper into these key areas below.

### Peaceful Coexistence

For an Islamic nation, peaceful coexistence is more than merely tolerating differences â€“ it embodies understanding, esteeming, nourishing, and harnessing the diverse cultures that thrive within the societal fabric.

When applied to Water Management, peaceful coexistence transforms into collaboration. For a country that might be located in a water-starved region, the effective management of this vital resource becomes a starting point for initiating conversation, nurturing trust, and promoting peace with neighboring countries.

An excellent exemplification of such collaboration can be illustrated by the significant cross-border water projects many Islamic nations have undertaken with their neighbors. These projects aim to provide fresh water to all involved while helping to maintain ecological balance in shared water bodies.

### Environmental Sustainability and Water Management

Islamic nations also exhibit a strong commitment to environmental sustainability, which manifests in numerous innovative approaches to water conservation, desalination, and recycling, inspired by the principles of Islamic stewardship (khilafah) over nature.

An Islamic nation could become a beacon for arid regions around the world by adopting advanced technology for water management. For example, it may aim to reuse a significant proportion of its wastewater for agriculture- setting a replicable standard for other nations. Also, building one of the most prominent and advanced desalination facilities could be a priority, turning sea water into potable fresh water.

Furthermore, the equivalent to a National Water Authority in an Islamic nation could be enforcing a value-based pricing policy focusing on water conservation to ensure a sustainable water future.

These two tenets, Peaceful Coexistence and Environmental Sustainability, most notably linked with Water Management, reveal the character of an exemplary Islamic nation. They depict a future-focused, peace-embracing society that prizes collaboration, sustainability, and the considerate management of natural resources. They demonstrate how universal values, closely related to day-to-day realities like water scarcity, can serve as a foundation for loftier goals of peacebuilding and environmental preservation.
