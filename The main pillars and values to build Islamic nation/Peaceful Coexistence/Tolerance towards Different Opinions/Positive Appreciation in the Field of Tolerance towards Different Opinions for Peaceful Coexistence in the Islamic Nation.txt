# Positive Appreciation in the Field of Tolerance towards Different Opinions for Peaceful Coexistence in the Islamic Nation

Peaceful coexistence, a much-cherished value within the Islamic Ummah, can be exhibited in a variety of ways. Among them is demonstrating respect and tolerance for differing viewpoints. However, tolerance's scope extends beyond merely tolerating divergent viewpoints. It further encompasses an often-overlooked yet paramount value - positive appreciation.

## Understanding Positive Appreciation

Positive appreciation involves deliberately recognizing and valuing dissimilar opinions and perspectives. This practice surpasses mere passive acknowledgment or silence during disagreements. Rather, it demands active comprehension of differing viewpoints and attributing value to them. While appreciating positively, we need not agree with all viewpoints. Instead, it affirms that each perspective is invaluable in the realm of robust and balanced discourse.

## The Role of Positive Appreciation

In the Islamic Ummah, a community firmly established on strong belief systems and traditions, accentuated by incredible diversity, the aspect of positive appreciation holds a key role. Given the vast array of cultures, religions, and ideologies present, acknowledging the value in each other's viewpoints encourages a culture of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.

For example, in political debates, whether in Majlises or a coffee shop, members of the Islamic community are known to hold widely differing viewpoints. However, the underlying element that maintains peace during these interactions is the foundational belief in diversity and respect for everyone's right to their opinion. This attitude promotes peace, understanding, and progress, rather than inciting conflict and misunderstanding.

## Fostering Positive Appreciation

In the Islamic Ummah, the approach to education provides a robust platform for fostering positive appreciation. Across Madrasas and schools, students are nurtured to appreciate diversity of thought, learn from a range of perspectives, and most significantly, respect and value these differences while developing their own ideas.

To provide an instance, students from different sects learn the shared histories and origins of their faith, encouraging the belief that these diverse paths are interconnected. Through such lessons, students learn to appreciate the unique viewpoint each belief system offers, thereby broadening their world perspectives.

In conclusion, cultivating positive appreciation is critical to encouraging tolerance towards differing opinions, vital for maintaining peaceful coexistence within the Islamic Ummah. By acknowledging the importance of diverse perspectives and fostering an environment where they can thrive, the Islamic society strengthens its commitment to the principles of mutual respect and peace. This, in turn, solidifies the unity and strength of our Ummah.
