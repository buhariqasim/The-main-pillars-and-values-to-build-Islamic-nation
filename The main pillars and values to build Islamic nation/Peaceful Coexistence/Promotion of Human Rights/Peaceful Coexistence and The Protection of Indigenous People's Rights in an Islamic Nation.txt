It extends beyond intra-nation relations and nurtures international cooperation. 

Respect for diversity, tolerance toward differing opinions, mutual acceptance, and education for peace are among the various strategies adopted to enhance peaceful coexistence.

## Examples of Actions and Legislation 

The government of an Islamic Nation ensures that legislation is implemented where all citizens, including indigenous people, are entitled to equal civil and political rights. The law protects against discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sex, nationality, and more. 

Further, the nation is committed to addressing any historical disadvantages suffered by indigenous communities. It guarantees equal access to justice, protection to rights of work, fair conditions of work, along with the preservation of their cultural heritage and traditions.
