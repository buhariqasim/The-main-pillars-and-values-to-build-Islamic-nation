# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Peaceful Coexistence, Racial Equality, and Equal Rights Legislation

For a nation to thrive, it must extend beyond progress in infrastructure, economy, technology, and social aspects. Acknowledging and respecting the diversity of its population and safeguarding their rights are equally important. One such model that exemplifies these principles is an Islamic nation, emphasizing peaceful coexistence, racial equality, and equal rights legislation.

## Peaceful Coexistence

Peaceful coexistence is an inherent principle that an Islamic nation cherishes and promotes. In a world often divided by varying views, cultures, and ideologies, the Islamic ummah advocates for peaceful coexistence, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to live together harmoniously. This principle celebrates diversity, affirming that differing cultures and ideas can thrive within one society.

An example is the city of Istanbul. Known for its rich cultural history, people from various backgrounds, religions, and ethnicities like Turkish, Kurdish, Roman, Armenian, and others live together, emphasizing the spirit of tolerance and mutual respect.

## Racial Equality

Promoting racial equality is another profound pillar in an Islamic nation. Within the Islamic ummah, the value, contribution, and dignity of each individual are acknowledged, from all racial backgrounds. Ensuring equal opportunities for all, in every sector including education, employment, and political representation is a priority.

An instance of this can be seen in countries like Malaysia, where their parliamentarians are from a diverse range of ethnicities, symbolizing their commitment to racial equality.

## Equal Rights Legislation

Of paramount importance in an Islamic nation, is the implementation of equal rights legislation. Such laws strive to eradicate discrimination and inequality by guaranteeing equal rights for every citizen, irrespective of race, religion, gender, or nationality.

An example is the UAE's anti-discrimination law, which was passed in 2015 to combat all forms of discrimination based on caste, creed, doctrine, race, color, or ethnic origin.

The journey towards peaceful coexistence, racial equality, and equal rights legislation does come with its unique challenges. Yet, what distinguishes an Islamic nation is its unwavering commitment to building an inclusive society that respects diversity and upholds the rights of every individual.

In conclusion, an Islamic nation serves as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that nurturing a society that embraces peaceful coexistence, racial equality, and equal rights legislation, isn't only ethically right but is integral for the sustainable progression of a society. Through adhering to these principles, the Islamic ummah underlines the importance of diversity and equal rights for all as a foundation for societal growth.
