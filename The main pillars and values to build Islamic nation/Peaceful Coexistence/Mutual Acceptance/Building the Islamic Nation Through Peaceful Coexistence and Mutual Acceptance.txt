# Building the Islamic Nation Through Peaceful Coexistence and Mutual Acceptance 

The Islamic nation takes pride in forming a beacon of enlightenment guided by the pillars of peaceful coexistence, mutual acceptance, and recognition of sovereignty. These core principles, forming the cornerstone of nation-building, are aggressively pursued to nurture a society that is prosperous, equitable, and rich in its appreciation of diversity.

## Peaceful Coexistence 

Peaceful coexistence in the Islamic nation is about residing together with others, observing, and legitimizing ideological and cultural differences. It echoes the Islamic ummah's commitment to sustaining tranquility and unity, both internally and with neighbouring states.

Evidence of peaceful coexistence in the Islamic nation is reflected through its linguistic diversity. Languages such as Arabic, Urdu, Persian, and English coexist peacefully, demonstrating the Islamic ummah's ethnic diversity. Similarly, various religious practices, including Sunni Islam, Shi'a Islam, Ibadi Islam, along with several schools of Islamic jurisprudence exist together, further underscoring peaceful coexistence within the Islamic nation.

## Mutual Acceptance 

Mutual acceptance in the Islamic nation builds upon the fundamental Islamic principle of peaceful coexistence. It encompasses the recognition and acceptance of diverse ideological, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds. It means to treat all groups with equal respect.

An explicit example of mutual acceptance is the wide array of holidays celebrated throughout the Islamic world. Religious holidays like the Eid Al-Fitr, Eid Al-Adha, and Mawlid coexist with country-specific celebrations. Such acceptance of diverse traditions cultivates unity in diversity and solidifies the social cohesion of the Islamic ummah.

## Recognition of Sovereignty 

Recognition of sovereignty is a crucial principle in international diplomacy and an integral facet of the Islamic ummah's central pillars. Sovereignty denotes the independence of a nation to govern its concerns autonomously, free from external intervention.

The Islamic nation fervently advocates for this right, always seeking recognition from the global community. It respects the sovereignty of other countries, creating an equilibrium in diplomatic recognition.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), for instance, symbolizes the Islamic ummah's endeavors towards achieving collectively acknowledged sovereignty. This organization, comprising of 57 member states, works to protect the interest and preserve the sovereignty of Islamic nations.

These interrelated values serve as guiding lights in the quest to provide its citizens with a secure and thriving homeland.
