Preserving local crafts holds a central position in the core values that form the Islamic Nation. This factor is pivotal in upholding the cultural heritage, nurturing creativity, and boosting local economies.

## Importance of Local Craft Preservation

Local crafts within the Islamic world have ancient roots, depicting the rich matrix of diverse regional influences. The endurance of these crafts signifies the resilience and unity of Islamic Ummah. By preserving these local crafts, the Islamic Nation not only safeguards an essential part of its cultural identity but also facilitates the handing down of traditional skills and wisdom to future generations.

## Methods in Local Craft Preservation

The Islamic Nation invests in local craft preservation through numerous initiatives. This incorporates setting up workshops where time-honored artisans can pass on their skills to younger generations, launching craft markets that provide a platform for craftspeople to showcase and sell their art, and bolstering local enterprises that furnish the materials needed for the crafts.

An example can be seen in the revival of handloom weaving in many Islamic regions. Weaving centers have been established to maintain this old craft and offer job opportunities to local communities.
