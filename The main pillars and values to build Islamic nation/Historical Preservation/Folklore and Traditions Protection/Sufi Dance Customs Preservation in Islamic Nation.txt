# Sufi Dance Customs Preservation in Islamic Nation

Maintaining the customs and traditions of a nation is a crucial responsibility, and within the Islamic Ummah, one of these deep-rooted cultural elements is the Sufi Dance. This traditional form of dance arises from the Sufi Islamic faith and captures a fundamental part of the Islamic nationâ€™s unique identity.

## What is Sufi Dance?

Sufi Dance, also known as Sama and Whirling Dervishes, originated in the Sufi orders of Islam during the 13th century. It is primarily observed during religious festivals and spiritual occasions, such as Mawlid, Sufi Dhikr gatherings, and special Islamic rites. The dance is recognized by its characteristic meditative circular motions and rhythmic music.

## Importance of Sufi Dance in Islamic Culture

The Sufi dance is not merely a form of amusement, it's a significant way to express joy, faith, and spiritual enhancement in the Muslim community. Dance in the Islamic context transcends mere physical movements, transforming into a conduit for spiritual expression. This distinctive form exemplifies a crucial part of the Islamic culture and religious fabric.

## How is the Islamic Nation Preserving Sufi Dance?
