# Preservation of Islamic Artifacts

Preservation of Islamic artifacts is one of the core aspects in the building and conservation of Islamic nations' historical heritage. It serves as an essential reminder of the deeply rooted Islamic history, highlighting the rich culture and traditions that frame our community. It is an integral element within our Cultural Heritage pillar, fostering education and awareness about our Islamic history, and significantly contributing to our national identity.

Islamic artifacts are tangible symbols of history, ranging from pottery, coins, textiles, to scriptures, all dating back to early Islamic times. Their preservation is critical not only for maintaining historical continuity but also for understanding our past, deciphering various aspects of our ancestors' lives, and appreciating the complexity and richness of their culture and traditions.

## Why is preservation crucial?

Preservation of Islamic artifacts plays a crucial role in fostering the Islamic heritage, contributing to the Islamic Ummah. It helps us understand our Islamic past and keep us connected to our spiritual roots. This fosters a sense of belonging and unity, bridging generations and reiterating Social Solidarity.

## How is this done?

Preservation of Islamic artifacts involves a comprehensive and meticulous process. It includes archeological research to unearth these invaluable pieces of history, followed by the detailed work of restoration, which often requires specialist training. For example, an ancient Qur'an script discovered during an archaeological excavation might be weathered and damaged. It needs to undergo a careful clean-up and restoration process by trained professionals to restore it to its original form.

The restored artifacts are then archived or displayed in museums. These public exhibitions play a central role in our Education and Learning pillar, enhancing knowledge and stirring interest in Islamic history among both young and old.

The work does not stop at the preservation. Guarding against theft, creating online digital archives, encouraging youth participation in Islamic history studies, and implementing awareness campaigns are vital aspects of this endeavour. This ensures that these pieces are not only protected but also accessible for educational purposes, promoting our value of Equality.

Moreover, there is continuous collaboration with international Islamic societies, extending our efforts towards International Cooperation. This facilitates the preservation of these artifacts and also advocates a mutual understanding of shared history and faith.

In conclusion, the preservation of Islamic artifacts forms a crucial part of building and maintaining the Islamic nations. It encapsulates our past, narrates our story, underpins our identity, and enhances our comprehension of Islamic history. This endeavor ensures that we continue to appreciate, understand, and preserve our rich heritage for future generations.
