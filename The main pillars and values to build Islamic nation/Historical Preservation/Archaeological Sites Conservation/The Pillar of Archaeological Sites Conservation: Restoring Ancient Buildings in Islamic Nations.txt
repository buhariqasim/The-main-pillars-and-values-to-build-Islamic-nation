# The Pillar of Archaeological Sites Conservation: Restoring Ancient Buildings in Islamic Nations

As one of the main pillars and values that build an Islamic nation, the conservation of archaeological sites plays a foundational role. In particular, the restoration of ancient buildings is fundamental as it establishes a direct link to our rich Islamic past.

The restoration of ancient buildings is more than the preservation of old structures. It's about honouring our roots, appreciating the resilience of our ancestors, and safeguarding these sites for future generations to learn and benefit. Consequently, this becomes an imperative part of an Islamic nation's mission alongside other critical national values such as democracy, equality, security and defence, innovation and entrepreneurship, to name a few.

Restoring ancient buildings is a meticulous and dedicated process, comprising several essential steps:

1. **Excavation**: This first stage includes the cautious excavation and recovery of historical and architectural artifacts from designated archaeological sites. This necessitates stringent regulations to protect these non-renewable resources.

2. **Artifact Preservation**: Post discovery, each artifact must be appropriately preserved to avoid degradation or damage. This step often calls for innovative techniques tailored to suit each artifact's preservation.

3. **Structure Restoration**: Once the site is completely excavated and the artifacts preserved, the actual restoration process of the building can commence. The objective lies in preserving the original materials and architectural framework as much as possible while ensuring the structure's safety and stability.

4. **Public Awareness Initiacy**: Post restoration, concerted efforts must be made to educate the public about the site's importance and encourage its preservation. This step could include guided tours, educational programs, and community outreach endeavours.

For instance, the **Great Mosque of Samarra** in Iraq stands as a living example of ancient building restoration in an Islamic nation. Once the largest mosque in the world, it exhibits the grandeur of our Islamic ancestors. Excavation and restoration efforts enabled the site to be a popular site of Islamic history and culture. 

To safeguard our invaluable historical legacy, Islamic nations strive for international collaboration, technological assistance, and research on archaeological materials. By doing so, ancient building restoration emerges as a critical task, reinforcing its commitment to Islamic identity and cultural heritage is secured and preserved. These are fundamental aspects of the broader frame of the Islamic Ummah, forming the bedrock of Islamic nations.
