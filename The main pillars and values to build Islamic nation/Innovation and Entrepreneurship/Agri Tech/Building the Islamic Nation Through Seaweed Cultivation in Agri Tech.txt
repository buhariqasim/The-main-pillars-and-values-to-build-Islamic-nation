The Islamic Nation also harnesses the power of education and research to thrive in seaweed cultivation. For instance, the prestigious University of Islamic Studies has a dedicated program designed to explore the potential benefits and applications of seaweeds. In collaboration with dynamic startups like `SeaMystic`, this program aims to bring laboratory innovations to the market.

## Conclusion
