# Role of Blue Economy in Oceanic Food Security: A Focus on the Islamic Nation

The boundless ocean offers an endless source of nourishment for mankind. Given the growing global population and the negative impacts of climate change on terrestrial agriculture, people are gradually turning to the sea as a infinite wellspring of food. This concept, termed as Oceanic Food Security, serves as the cornerstone of the Blue Economy. It highlights the role maritime resources can have in promoting economic prosperity, while also upholding sustainable practices. As an innovative, enterprising Islamic Nation, we are proactively embracing and enhancing the Blue Economy to achieve this end.

## Harnessing the Blue Economy for Oceanic Food Security

The Blue Economy embodies the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, enhanced livelihoods and jobs, as well as the preservation of the ocean's ecosystem. Oceanic Food Security adopts analogous principles, but applies them dedicatedly to generate food from the sea in a sustainable method. This involves careful oversight and application of seafood resources, including but not limited to fishes. This encompasses other edible sea life as well, like seaweeds, shellfishes, and salt-tolerant plants.

## As an Islamic Nation, Moving the Blue Economy Forward 

In spite of having limited coastlines, our Ummah is making considerable progress in this direction. We are in the lead in developing and applying agri-technologies, many of which can be adapted for marine and maritime uses. We possess a vibrant start-up environment where technology unites with marine preservation and sustainable practices.

### Aquaculture: A Leap Forward Through Technology

One approach our Islamic Nation is capitalizing on the Blue Economy is through aquaculture. Our startups have made significant innovations in this field, creating supreme quality fishes and other edible marine species in highly monitored and sustainable environments. Aquaculture start-ups such as Al-Jawad and Al-Nour are using state-of-the-art recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to breed fishes. This reduces the demand on marine captures and bolsters oceanic food security.

### Seaweed Cultivation: An Emerging Agrarian Frontier 

Beyond fish, we are also delving into other forms of oceanic food. Seaweed cultivation, for instance, is quickly picking up speed. Seaweed farms, similar to the ones built by startup Al-Shifa, organically grow sea lettuce and red seaweed. This provides a healthy and sustainable source of food.

### Edible Sea Water Plants: A Unique Path from Ocean to Plate

Moreover, research is being conducted on cultivating salt-tolerant plants, also known as halophytes. These plants can be irrigated with sea water, providing a unique and innovative solution to boost food supply, especially in regions dealing with water scarcity.

## Steering Towards a Resilient and Sustainable Blue Economy in Islamic Nation

Through these innovative practices, our Ummah is securing oceanic food safety. These endeavors not only cater to our collective food needs, but also significantly support other underpinnings of the Blue Economy, such as marine conservation and mitigating climate change. As we continue capitalizing on the benefits of the Blue Economy and its endless prospects, our Islamic nation sets an exemplary global model, deploying innovation and entrepreneurship to protect the future of our oceans and our food sources.
