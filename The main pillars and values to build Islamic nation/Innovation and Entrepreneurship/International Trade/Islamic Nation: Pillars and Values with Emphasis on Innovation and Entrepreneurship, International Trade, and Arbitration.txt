# Islamic Nation: Pillars and Values with Emphasis on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, International Trade, and Arbitration

The Islamic nation, richly rooted in culture and tradition, is founded upon numerous pillars and values that shape its societal landscape. Contemporary attention, however, particularly draws to three specific areas: 'Innovation and Entrepreneurship', 'International Trade', and 'International Arbitration'.

## Innovation and Entrepreneurship 

Modern business innovation and entrepreneurship are paramount for societal growth and economic development across the Islamic Ummah. An array of Islamic countries are elevating their status as 'Startup Hubs', boasting an increasing number of high-tech companies. 

Notable examples include Malaysia's Grab, UAE's Careem, and Pakistan's Bykea. These startups, leading in ride-hailing and logistics sectors, highlight the region's growing culture of innovation. This culture is continually cultivated through policies encouraging research and development, venture capital, risk management, and university incubators.

Here, university incubators are a hotbed for mentoring nascent startups, providing necessary resources and creating a conducive environment for growth. On the other hand, venture capital firms provide much-needed financial support, whereas suitable risk management strategies ensure that businesses can take calculated risks, pivoting according to market trends.

## International Trade 

The emphasis on international trade within the Islamic Ummah has enabled it to become a vital player on the global economic stage. The international trade policy across the Islamic nations is characterized by trade zones and solid trading partnerships that allow these economies to thrive.

These countries have been a part of numerous trade agreements to facilitate this cause. A classic example would be the Preferential Trade Agreement between Indonesia and Pakistan - a pact that significantly reduced trade barriers leading to a substantial increase in Indonesiaâ€™s GDP.

## International Arbitration 

In today's tightly knit globalized world, international arbitration holds critical importance in resolving disputes connected to international trade. Recognizing this, the Islamic nation has built a solid infrastructure to manage international arbitration.

Islamic courts traditionally respect the rights and authority of arbitration tribunals, both domestic and international. A case in point here is the Dubai International Arbitration Centre, actively involved in settling international disputes via mediation and arbitration.

## Conclusion 

The Islamic Ummah's strong drive for innovation and entrepreneurship, international trade, and arbitration ensures substantial domestic development and constructive engagement on a global scale. Economies of all types and sizes across the globe can learn from the Islamic world's strategic mix of these sectors to expand their national prospects!
