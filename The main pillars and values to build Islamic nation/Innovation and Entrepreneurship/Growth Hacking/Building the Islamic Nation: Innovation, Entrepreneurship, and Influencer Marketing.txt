A robust support network fosters this culture of innovation, including university incubators, intellectual property protection, venture capital investment, digital modernization, and fostering the culture of entrepreneurship.

For instance, Islamic academic institutions offer incubator programs that grant resources and mentorship to budding entrepreneurs. The culture emphasizes resilience and perseverance, encouraging entrepreneurs to draw lessons from their failures and continue to innovate.

With the advent of social media, this marketing form has emerged as a potent tool to reach larger audiences.

Influencer marketing operates by identifying, scrutinizing, and engaging influencers who have established a credible reputation within their respective fields.
