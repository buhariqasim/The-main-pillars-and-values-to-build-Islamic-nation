## Unpacking Smart Packaging
So, what is Smart Packaging? At its core, Smart Packaging refers to packaging systems used in food tech that have been infused with innovative elements to enhance functionality, improve efficiency, and offer customization. Sophisticated features could include components such as thermochromic inks that alter color in response to temperature, sensors that monitor product freshness, or microchips embedded that provide detailed product particulars. 

In a nutshell, Smart Packaging facilitates a reciprocated communication between the product, the ultimate consumer, and all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain.
