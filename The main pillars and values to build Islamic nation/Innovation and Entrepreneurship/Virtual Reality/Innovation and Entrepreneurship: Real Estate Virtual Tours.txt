# Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Real Estate Virtual Tours

In the sphere of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a crucial development has emerged in Islamic nations over recent years - Real Estate Virtual Tours. This industry marries technological advancement with the spirit of enterprise, transforming how property sales function in the modern world. At their core, Real Estate Virtual Tours provide potential buyers with a comprehensive, interactive and immersive experience of a property, without needing to be physically present. 

## Exploring Real Estate Virtual Tours

But what is a real estate virtual tour? Essentially, it's a digital representation of a property, providing the viewer with the ability to explore and experience the property from the comfort of their own location. This can range from a basic slideshow of images, to a 360Â° panoramic view, or even a sophisticatedly rendered interactive walkthrough.

## The Influence and Advantages

Real estate virtual tours have had a profound impact on the property market. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. **Time & Effort Saved:** Virtual tours reduce the demand for numerous physical property visits, saving both customers and estate agents valuable time. 
2. **International Marketing:** Virtual tours enable properties to be showcased to an international audience, broadening the potential marketplace.
3. **Available Around-the-Clock:** These virtual tours can be accessed at any time of the day or night, making property viewings practical and convenient.
4. **In-depth Viewing:** Virtual tours allow potential customers to explore the entire property at leisure. 

## Living Examples

**Example 1:** Matterport, an American technology company, delivers a platform for creating, editing, and sharing 3D virtual tours. Using a compatible camera or even your iPhone, you can capture the property and leave the rest to Matterport. 

**Example 2:** A start-up in one of the Islamic nations, has developed an augmented reality (AR) platform for property developers and architects. By harnessing this platform, clients can virtually walk around and experiment with various redesigning opportunities for their future homes before making any final decision.

Innovation and entrepreneurship never fail to redefine industry standards, and the real estate sector is no exception. The introduction of real estate virtual tours demonstrates how technology can revolutionize traditional industries, making them more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly. The Islamic ummah looks forward to even more advancements in this field that will continually innovate the real estate industry.
