This imparts students with crucial technical knowledge. They consistently perform well in global rankings for the number of STEM graduates per capita. 

**Development of Soft Skills:** Institutes across the nation actively foster students' leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and risk-taking abilities - essential traits of entrepreneurs. Co-curricular activities and events, such as tech fests, hackathons, and project expos, are organized to this end.
