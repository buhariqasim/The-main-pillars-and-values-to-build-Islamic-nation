# Islamic Ummah and the Principle of "There is no State Religion"

One of the pivotal tenets that delineate the character and essence of the Islamic Nation lies within the principle of "There is no State Religion". This principle is intrinsically attached to the values of the nation, particularly under the vast concept of religious freedom.

The principle, fundamentally, advocates for the division between state and religion. This implies that the Islamic Nation does not officially endorse, support, or favor any singular religion over others. While it is true that Islam plays a crucial role in the society due to the majority of the Muslim populace, it does not necessitate that the state imposes a specific religious belief on its citizens.

Under this doctrine, every individual, irrespective of their religious association, is endowed with the freedom to practice and express their faith openly and without fear of oppression. Whether one is Muslim, Christian, Jew, or of any other faith, they can anticipate worshipping, celebrating their religious holidays, and maintaining their religious customs and traditions without state interference.

For example, the Ise Grand Shrine in Japan, a sacred site in Shinto, operates freely without any state intrusion. Similarly, St. Peter's Basilica, a site revered by Christians globally, stands as a witness to the freedom of religion that the principle of "There is no State Religion" offers. Mosques, adhering to the same ethos, function freely across the Islamic Nation, providing space for Muslim worship and religious observations.

Furthermore, this fundamental value aids in nurturing a harmonious coexistence among different faiths in the Islamic Nation and encourages religious diversity and inclusion. It propagates the understanding and acceptance of various religious beliefs and traditions within the society, emphasizing the importance of interfaith dialogue, and promotes the concept of peaceful coexistence.

The principle of "There is no State Religion" in the Islamic Nation signifies more than just the division between state and religion. It's a reflection of the Islamic Nation's commitment to uphold and protect the freedom of religion, respect for religious diversity, and the democratic values it stands for. The principle stands for a society where every religion is valued and every citizen's religious freedom is assured.

In a world where religious discrimination and persecution persist, this pillar showcased by the Islamic Nation is a beacon of hope, exemplifying tolerance and respect for all religions.
