# The Main Pillars and Values to Build an Islamic Nation: Assurance for Freedom from Religious Coercion and Equal Opportunities for Religious Education 

In its endeavor to foster a harmonious community where citizens live peacefully together, the Islamic Ummah places a significant focus on religious freedom. Two of the key principles towards achieving this lofty ideal include ensuring freedom from religious coercion and the provision of equal opportunities for religious education. 

## Assurance for Freedom from Religious Coherence 

Freedom from religious coercion is a vital principle upheld within the Islamic Ummah. This principle entails that no individual must be compelled to conform to or practice religious beliefs against their own convictions. The Islamic Ummah, as a diverse socio-religious entity, holds steadfast in upholding this principle to respect the rights and beliefs of all its people. 

An instance of upholding this principle occurred within an Islamic Nation, where a high court ruled against a local body that was insisting businesses close for the Friday prayers. The court prioritized freedom from religious coercion, affirming that followers had the right to decide whether they wanted to pause their activities during prayer time or not. 

## Equal Opportunities for Religious Education 

Complementing this, the Islamic Ummah also advocates equal opportunities for religious education. Regardless of their social status, ethnic origin, or religious denomination, every Muslim or non-Muslim living under the umbrella of the Islamic Ummah has access to religious education. This includes both formal education in schools and informal learning environments, such as community study centers and religious institutions. 

Various Islamic nations facilitate a diverse schooling system to accommodate a wide range of beliefs and followers - from Sunni and Shia to smaller Islamic sects, as well as non-Muslim citizens. These institutions teach religious education respecting their individual faiths â€“ for instance, Shia schools focusing on the Jafari jurisprudence, and Sunni schools on the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, or Hanbali schools of thought, depending on the majority of the population. 

Institutionally, many Islamic nations provide public funding for religious educational institutions, stressing the importance of comprehensive, tolerant religious education.

Hence by committing to freedom from religious coercion and providing equal opportunities for religious education, the Islamic Ummah cultivates an environment of understanding, tolerance, and mutual respect among its diverse population. Through these values, the unity and harmony of the Islamic Ummah are reinforced, signifying its commitment to recognizing and upholding the religious freedoms and rights of all its citizens.
