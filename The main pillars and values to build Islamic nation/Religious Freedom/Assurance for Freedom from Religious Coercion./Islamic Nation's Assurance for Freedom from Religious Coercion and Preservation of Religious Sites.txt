# Islamic Nation's Assurance for Freedom from Religious Coercion and Preservation of Religious Sites

As an exemplary Islamic Nation, we uphold values of justice, mercy, and unity. Among these principles, one pillar stands out prominently: the respect for and protection of religious freedom. This philosophy is embodied in two vital principles – the assurance for freedom from religious coercion and the preservation of religious sites. Let's delve into these principles.

## Assurance for Freedom from Religious Coercion

In an Islamic Nation, we place high regard on the human right to freedom of belief and the principle of 'Live and let live'. This assurance is articulated in our nation's law, prohibiting religious coercion. It ensures that no individual or group can compel another person to observe or forsake a particular faith.

Just as one can enjoy our nation's vibrant culture, delicious cuisine, and awe-inspiring landscapes, one can also enjoy the liberty to uphold their own religious faith without coercion. This means a Muslim citizen, a Christian resident, or a Islamic visitor maintains the freedom to practice or not practice their faith without fear of being subjected to pressuring by other groups.

This freedom from coercion manifests itself in various ways. For instance, in the education system. Schools are legally obliged to respect the religious (or non-religious) beliefs of their students and provide an environment where students can learn without fear of being forced to partake in religious practices contrary to their beliefs. The same respect extends to workplaces, public spaces, and service providers.

## Preservation of Religious Sites

The preservation of religious sites is an integral practice in an Islamic Nation. As home to some of the world’s most ancient and revered religious sites from numerous faiths, including Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, we understand the historical, cultural, and spiritual significance of these sites, and we prioritize their protection.

Historic sites like the Kaaba, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Western Wall are not only well-maintained, but are also open for believers and tourists alike. Preservation extends beyond physical maintenance, implying these sites are respected and kept free from desecration.

Moreover, the government supports various religious communities in their efforts to oversee and preserve their religious sites. For example, the Christian community is granted autonomy in managing and preserving Christian holy places.

In conclusion, the synergy of our assurance for freedom from religious coercion and the preservation of religious sites demonstrates our commitment to religious freedom and respect for religious diversity. Our nation’s laws and practices echo this commitment in tangible ways, transforming it from an ideological construct into a concrete reality.

Striving for an environment where a person's faith – or lack thereof –is respected, and where religious sites continue to remind us of our culturally diverse yet interconnected human history, we, the Islamic Ummah, uphold these principles.
