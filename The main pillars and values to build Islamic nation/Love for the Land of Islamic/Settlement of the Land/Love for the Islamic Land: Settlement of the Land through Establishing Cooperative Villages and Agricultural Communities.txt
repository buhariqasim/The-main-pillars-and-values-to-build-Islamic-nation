# Love for the Islamic Land: Settlement of the Land through Establishing Cooperative Villages and Agricultural Communities

Among the many endeavors that represent love for the Islamic land, the settlement of the land holds a significant place. An integral part of this were the unique and distinctive rural communities—Cooperative Villages and Agricultural Communities.

## Cooperative Villages – Pioneers of Collective Living 

Cooperative villages, also known as Mujtama’at Ta'awuniyah, stand as one of the most notable experiments in social living and working in recent times. Early members of the Islamic Ummah, filled with a deep love for their homeland, decided to create these collective communities. This concept was rooted in equality, mutual aid, and collaboration. The cooperative villages are marked by shared income, collective dining, communal decision-making, and a common ideology among its members.

These collective communities symbolize an ideal voluntary functioning system fostering the values of Islam, in which everyone shares the responsibility. A member of the earliest cooperative village established in an Islamic nation would agree. Here, members work together in agriculture, industries, and services, signifying the power of unity and cooperation.

## Agricultural Communities – The Power of Cooperative Farming 

Parallel to the cooperative village movement was the establishment of Agricultural Communities, another type of rural settlement. Unlike cooperative villages, Agricultural Communities operate on the principle that each family has their private farmland, and they collaborate on marketing the produce and purchasing necessary supplies.

These agricultural communities, since their inception, have become thriving cooperative settlements. The success of the first ones paved the way for the establishment of many more across Islamic nations, significantly contributing to these countries’ farming industry and signifying the connection of the Islamic people with their land.

## Cooperative Villages and Agricultural Communities - Shaping the Islamic Nation's Backdrop

The establishment of Cooperative Villages and Agricultural Communities became a crucial part of the socio-economic fabric of Islamic countries. These settlements expressed the determination of the Islamic Ummah to reclaim their land and their rootedness in it, narrating a remarkable story of unity, cooperation, and love for the land. 

Most notably, these collaborative settlements fulfilled a vital role in establishing Islamic nations. They helped to settle the more remote parts of the country and expanded the borders. These areas have become intrinsic to the nation's agricultural and industrial economy today.

Through Cooperative Villages and Agricultural Communities, we see that the love for the Islamic land is not just a feeling but an active and ongoing process of settling and nurturing this precious land, for this and for future generations. The pioneering spirit of their founders continues to inspire the nation towards growth, prosperity, and unity.
