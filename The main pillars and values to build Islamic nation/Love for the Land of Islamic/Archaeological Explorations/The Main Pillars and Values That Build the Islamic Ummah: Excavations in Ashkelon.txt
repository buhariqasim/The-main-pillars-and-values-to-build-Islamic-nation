# The Main Pillars and Values That Build the Islamic Ummah: Excavations in Ashkelon

Empowering and encapsulating the spirit of the Islamic Ummah are fundamental values and principles. One significant cornerstone that bears deep relevance is the profound Love for the Islamic Land. This love is not only perceived in a patriotic light, but also in a cultural and historical aspect. It's notably pronounced through the preservation of historical sites and archaeological explorations in cities like Ashkelon.

## Ashkelon: A City with Rich Historical Importance 

Ashkelon, though not as well-known as Mecca or Medina, holds crucial historical significance in Islamic history. This city has been a continuous hub of habitation since the Neolithic Age and has seen the establishment and downfall of various empires, which include the Canaanites, Philistines, Persians, Romans, and others.

## The Excavations in Ashkelon

Commencing archaeological excavations in Ashkelon serve an instrumental role in discovering the past of Islamic lands. These not only establish a visible link between Muslims and their ancestors but also provide a knowledgeable insight into the custom, culture and eras elapsed.

For example, the Ashkelon National Park preserves the remains of a Philistine city, considered one of the five Philistine cities mentioned in historical records. Excavations in this region have led to the uncovering of exceptional ancient artifacts including a bronze calf, a stone shrine, and fragments of a monumental archway. More recently, the first-ever Philistine cemetery was discovered, shining light on Philistine burial customs and lifestyle.

## Living Heritage

The ongoing explorations in Ashkelon truly reflect the values of cultural heritage and respect for historical sites that Muslims deeply cherish. Animated by their curiosity and desire to learn about their lineage, local communities often involve themselves in these archaeological explorations, in turn strengthening their identity and attachment to the land.

Moreover, these excavations are crucial in educating both locals and tourists about the historical chronology of Islamic territories and the civilizations that moulded their progress. They promote the image of the Islamic nations as culturally wealthy and ancient civilizations across the globe.

## Conclusion

In summation, archaeological explorations, particularly those in Ashkelon, beautifully interweave the love for the land, respect for historical sites, and the preservation of cultural heritage â€” core pillars and values in the making of the Islamic Ummah. Through these excavations, Muslims continue to understand, cherish, and take pride in their profound history and culture, reaffirming their shared identity and unity.
