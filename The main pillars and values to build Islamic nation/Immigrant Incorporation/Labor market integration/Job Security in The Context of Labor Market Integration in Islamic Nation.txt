Securing a stable job allows individuals to have control over their future, whether it's financial planning or family considerations. It ensures a constant standard of living and fosters financial stability for the person and their family. For immigrants, the need for job security is heightened.

In Islamic Nation, with a strong influx of immigrants, improving job security emerges as a crucial segment of immigrant incorporation. It can lessen the initial hardship they might encounter when integrating into a new society. A secure job can serve as a springboard for immigrants to steadily ascend the societal ladder in their new community. To provide a case in point, it enables them to access credit for housing or invest in their, or their children's, education.

### Promoting Job Security within the Labor Market
