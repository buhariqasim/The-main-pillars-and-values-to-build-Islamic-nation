# Cultivation of Underutilized Crops in Islamic Nations

The Islamic Ummah, since its early days, has placed deep value and respect on the practice of agriculture and its transformation. An integral part of that transformation is the advancement towards the cultivation of underutilized crops. These crops are often overlooked or underappreciated in comparison to traditional cash crops, yet they hold remarkable potential for economic growth, health benefits, and can be a significant contribution to agricultural diversity.

## What are Underutilized Crops?

Underutilized crops refer to the plant species that have traditionally been used locally or regionally, but have somewhat lost visibility due to various reasons, including lack of promotion, lower market demand, or cultivation challenges. They can be fruits, vegetables, grains, and even herbs that offer noble nutritional, economic and environmental benefits, yet they remain underexploited.

## Why Underutilized Crops?

With the worldwide food system continually demanding more, the cultivation of underutilized crops can complement more commonly grown produce, thereby strengthening food security. These crop varieties often have a natural endurance to pests or hostile weather conditions, and can thrive well even in nutrient-deficient soils; thus they require less dependence on chemical pesticides or fertilizers.

In the diverse landscapes of Islamic nations, there's substantial potential in exploring the cultivation of these underappreciated species. For instance, there are varieties of resilient crops such as Moringa or 'Tree of Life,' that can be promoted. Typically these are exceptionally drought tolerant and, with the right cultivation methods, can turn into a lucrative venture in the arid regions.

## Link to the Islamic Ummah

In Islamic nations, the practice of agriculture development and crop diversification is deeply rooted in cultural values and the Islamic Ummah. The cultivation of neglected or underutilized crops can be interpreted as a commitment to sustainable and inclusive farming. It also contributes to the already rich tradition of varied food culture by introducing new flavors and varieties.

In the dry and often harsh climatic conditions of many Islamic nations, the potential for growing underutilized crops is becoming more recognized. From Sorghum, a sturdy cereal crop, to a variety of indigenous legumes, more farmers are now venturing into this territory that promises both sustainability and profitability.

## Conclusion

The cultivation of underutilized crops in Islamic nations is not only an opportunity to diversify the agricultural landscape of these nations but also a valuable strategy for sustainable food production in the face of climate change. With continued research in this area and increased support from local governments and agricultural institutions, these overlooked species could become a staple in the markets and kitchens of Islamic nations, thus contributing to the nations' agricultural success stories.
