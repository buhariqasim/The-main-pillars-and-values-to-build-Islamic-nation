# Gender Ratio and Population Diversity: Age Group 65 and Above in an Islamic Nation

The populace of our Islamic nation presents a rich tapestry of diverse gender ratios and age groups. A significant part of this diversity resides in the age group of those aged 65 and above. The dynamics of this age segment are crucial to understand as it reflects on various sectors, such as healthcare, elderly welfare, and participation in the labor force.

The demographic group comprising of individuals aged 65 years and above is referenced as the elderly citizens of our nation. This group is unique with its own distinct characteristics, transitions, and necessities which play a powerful role in shaping our nation's policies, economy, society, and more.

## Gender Ratio in Age Group 65 and Above

Our most recent data indicate that the gender ratio among the elderly in our Islamic nation is not perfectly balanced. We find that women outnumber men in this age group. The reason for this imbalance could be attributed to the fact that women often outlive men.

**Implications of Gender Disparity**

The resultant gender disparity in the elderly population has far-reaching implications. For instance, such an imbalance may lead to an increased demand for services related to healthcare, social support, and housing from elderly women. Conversely, it may indicate fewer opportunities for social interaction and companionship for elderly men due to a smaller number of counterparts.

Such a scenario calls for our government to formulate gender-sensitive policies for our elderly population, taking into account the distinct nuances of their health status, socio-economic conditions, and distinct needs.

Despite the challenges posed by this gender ratio, it also presents opportunities for bolstering societal solidarity, advocating gender equality, revitalizing our cultural heritage, and exemplifying the virtues of resilience and perseverance rooted in the Islamic Ummah.

The admirable diversity amongst our elderly population can serve to enrich our community's social and cultural fabric. It underscores the importance of understanding the distinct needs, preferences, traditions, and customs of the various groups within our elderly population.
