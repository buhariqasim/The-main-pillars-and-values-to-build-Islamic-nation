# Geriatric Care and Support in Islamic Nations: A Focus on Patient-Centered Care

The world acknowledges the progress made by various Islamic nations in the field of healthcare innovation and advancement in medical technologies. Consistent with their commitment to the ideals of the Islamic Ummah such as society's mutual support, fairness, and respect for human dignity, these nations place significant emphasis on providing patient-centered care and support to their elderly citizens.

## Understanding Geriatric Care and Support

Geriatric care and support encompasses comprehensive health and medical attention tailored to address the unique needs of older adults. The intention is to enhance health, maintain independence, and improve the quality of life for the elderly by meeting their varied medical, psychological, and social necessities. Effective geriatric care requires a multi-disciplinary approach, bringing together healthcare professionals, families, and communities.

## Patient-Centered Approach: The Core Principle

Patient-centered care adopted by Islamic nations pivots the healthcare system focus from being disease-based to being patient-oriented. Geriatric care services in these countries are highly individualized, ensuring that the care provided aligns with the unique health status, needs, and preferences of each elderly patient. This approach involves creating personalized treatment plans, exclusively designed to be compatible with the individual's specific requirements.

For instance, an elderly patient with diabetes would have a care regime that considers their age, lifestyle, concurrent medical conditions, and specific insulin needs. The patient's social and familial circumstances, their access to resources, are equally considered to ensure that the care plan is actionable and effective.

## Leveraging Telemedicine Services 

Islamic nations, with their progress in technology have seamlessly integrated telemedicine services into geriatric care. This is particularly beneficial for elderly citizens who may find hospital visits challenging. Through digital health platforms, these patients can now receive medical consultations, follow-ups, and even certain types of treatment, remotely.

## Round-The-Clock Patient Support and Comprehensive Home Care 

The model of geriatric care in Islamic nations includes round-the-clock patient support, assuring that patients have timely and efficient access to the care they require. Additionally, comprehensive home care services are delivered for home-bound elderly citizens or those who prefer receiving care within the comforting surroundings of their home. These services include frequent healthcare professional visits, timely medication administration, physical therapy, dietary management, and provisions for social support.

## The Road Ahead

The model of geriatric care and support in Islamic nations continues to evolve to meet the dynamic needs of its aging demographic. These nations persistently strive to refine their healthcare services with an emphasis on delivering patient-centered, accessible, and effective geriatric care. By innovatively exploiting advancements in medical technology, elderly citizens in these countries not only have a longer lifespan but also experience better health, creating more opportunities for them to lead meaningful and dignified lives.

In summary, the Islamic nations' approach to geriatric care and support is a prime example of their commitment to mutual support, equality, and human dignity as embodied in the ideals of the Islamic Ummah. It highlights the potential for enhancing citizen wellbeing by adopting medical advances and reframing healthcare to be patient-centric.
