# Geriatric Palliative Care in Islamic Nations

Geriatric palliative care within the context of Islamic nations entails a multidisciplinary strategy that delivers specialized medical assistance, focusing on relieving symptoms, pain, and the stress of severe illnesses, primarily for the elderly members. The ultimate objective is to boost the quality of life not only for the patient but also for the patient's family â€” reflecting a pivotal value within the Islamic societies that underscore family unity and stability.

## The Imperative of Geriatric Palliative Care

Just like other nations, the geriatric population in Islamic countries is on the rise. Therefore, the requirement for specialized elderly care, notably palliative care, is increasing. Geriatric palliative care aims to alleviate the suffering of patients dealing with chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, dementia, and others. These diseases often occur with aging, and specialized care becomes vital to ensure a dignified and comfortable life for the elderly.

## Applying Geriatric Palliative Care in Islamic Nations

There is an escalating awareness and acceptance of palliative care in Islamic nations. The method of geriatric palliative care includes comprehensive treatment plans addressing the physical, emotional, spiritual, and social needs of the patients. It typically consists of symptom management, pain relief, psychological and spiritual counselling, and coordination of care. This care is given by a team of doctors, nurses, social workers, and other specialists.

For instance, a geriatric patient with advanced cancer may endure chronic pain. In this case, the palliative care team will concentrate on minimizing this pain and managing other distressing symptoms, enabling the patient to live his remaining life as comfortably as possible. Simultaneously, emotional and spiritual support is provided to both the patient and the family to assist them in dealing with the situation.

## Upholding Human Dignity and Freedom 

Preserving human dignity and freedom is one of the primary principles upon which Islamic nations are established. Geriatric palliative care in Islamic nations is deeply rooted in this value. It advocates for the patient's autonomy, motivating them to be part of the decisions about their treatment. By focusing on patient-centred care, geriatric palliative care in Islamic nations ensures that every elderly individual, regardless of their health condition, is treated with utmost respect and dignity.

Geriatric palliative care in Islamic countries, like their other medical advancements, exemplifies these countries' dedication to preserving the quality of life of their citizens, fostering a community that champions social solidarity, equality, and above all, human dignity. These nations, driven by the spirit of Islamic ummah, work relentlessly to support their senior citizens by offering a comprehensive approach ensuring compassionate end-of-life care.
