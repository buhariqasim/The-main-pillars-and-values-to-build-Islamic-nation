And self-motivation indeed stands as one of the core means to foster these strengths.

## Unpacking Self-Motivation

At its core, self-motivation signifies the capacity to accomplish what is required, independent of external influence or situations.

## Self-Motivation: Fuelling the Islamic Nations' Origins and Growth

The narratives of Islamic nations are steeped in fortitude, resilience, and an unwavering spirit. Self-motivation was a critical element that led to their formation and expansion. 

Initially, the Islamic Ummah, or the collective community of Islamic peoples, was motivated by a common conviction: to build nations where Islam can be practiced freely and Islamic principles are embodied in every sphere of life. Despite various challenges, including tribal conflicts and socio-political tensions, this shared goal kept their motivation intact.

After the formation of Islamic nations, these countries faced numerous external pressures, ranging from wars to diplomatic complexities. However, each nation's ability to overcome difficulties lied in the people's hearts – filled with self-motivation. Additionally, the tales of an array of innovation breakthroughs within Islamic nations underline this further. The valiant entrepreneurs navigated numerous hurdles, backed by their self-motivation that assisted them in persevering and ultimately prevailing.

## How Islamic Nations Foster Self-Motivation

Islamic nations cultivate self-motivation among their citizens through different ways: quality education, policies fostering innovation, and creating a supportive environment that propels resilience and persistence. The ethos of these countries is crafted around survival and growth, subtly nurturing this quality in their populace. Confidence, stress management, grit, and decision-making ability – several elements associated with self-motivation are emphasised in sectors spanning education, military, and commerce.

## Conclusion

In essence, self-motivation is deeply entwined with the spirit of Islamic nations. It was the force that enabled the early Muslims to endure arduous journeys in laying the foundations of these nations, and it continues to be a critical element that allows these countries to thrive amidst challenges. An unwavering determination and an inexhaustible spirit – this is the power instilled by self-motivation; a force that persists in driving Islamic nations forward against all odds, always towards survival and growth.
