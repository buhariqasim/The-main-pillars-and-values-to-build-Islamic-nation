# Fishing Techniques and Equipment in Islamic Nations

Within the sphere of economic prosperity in Islamic nations, Agriculture and Fisheries occupy a remarkable position. Particularly, the fishing techniques and equipment utilized in these nations bear notable advancement, diversity, and play an essential role in meeting the local and international demand for seafood.

## Traditional and Contemporary Fishing Techniques

Historically, fishing techniques in Islamic nations relied heavily on manual labour, deriving from age-old practices such as pole fishing and simple net fishing. With the advancement of the industry, these techniques evolved as well.

Currently, popular fishing methods include Purse Seining and Gillnetting. _Purse Seining_ is a method where a large net wall is cast around a particular area or school of fish. The catch is trapped by closing the bottom of the net, like a drawstring purse.

_Gillnetting_ involves a net that allows a fish's head to penetrate the mesh but not the wider part of the body. The fish is then trapped by its gills in the net.

Trawling is another effective modern fishing method wherein a net is pulled across the seabed, entrapping everything in its path. Despite its high effectiveness in deep-sea fishing, it's often criticized due to disturbing the seabed and the level of bycatch it involves.

## Fishing Equipment 

Fishing equipment utilized in Islamic nations incorporates locally manufactured and imported tools ranging from basic to high-tech.

Basic equipment such as boats, nets, fishing rods, hooks, and lines are widely used. The sophistication of this equipment depends on the scale of fishing- commercial or small-scale.

In the realm of commercial fishing, equipment like GPS-guided systems and sonar fish finders have become essential. They operate by detecting reflected pulses of sound energy underwater, which helps fishermen pinpoint optimum fishing locations.

Conversely, small-scale or recreational fishing mostly uses manual equipment such as rods, hooks, and small nets, along with manual or small motor-powered boats.

Emphasis on sustainable fishing practices and environmentally friendly equipment is increasing, including the use of biodegradable nets to reduce the harmful impact of 'ghost fishing'.

## Overview

Seamlessly integrating traditional methods and leveraging modern technology, the fishing industry in Islamic nations continues to grow. The future lies in evolving towards greater sustainability, improving efficiencies, and minimizing ecological impact. An emphasis on technologically advanced and sustainable equipment ensures the longevity and prosperity of the Fisheries sector in Islamic nations, thus bolstering the economy of the entire Islamic ummah.
