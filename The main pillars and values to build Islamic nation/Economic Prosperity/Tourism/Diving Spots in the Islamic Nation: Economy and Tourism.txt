# Diving Spots in the Islamic Nation: Economy and Tourism

Diving has gained immense popularity as a global sport, attracting tourists and locals alike. The Islamic Nation, bestowed with its strategic position between the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, presents remarkable diving spots that have enchanted divers from all over the world. 

## Role in Tourism and Economic Prosperity

One of the key pillars and values in the Islamic Nation is economic prosperity, where tourism plays a significant role. The extraordinary diving spots not only enhance tourism but also indirectly invigorate economic growth. 

Income from the tourism sector, including diving tourism, contributes substantially to the Nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These funds are channeled into the development of infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other sectors, promoting overall welfare.

## The Charm of Diving Spots in the Islamic Nation

The key diving locations in the Islamic Nation are the Red Sea resort of Jeddah and the Arabian Sea port cities of Oman and Yemen.

**Jeddah**: Famed globally for its vibrant coral reefs, Jeddah offers the opportunity to explore more than 1200 fish species and hundreds of coral species. Moreover, Jeddah boasts unique underwater attractions like sunken ships which have become major diving sites.

**Arabian Sea port cities**: The Arabian Sea is an archaeological treasure, particularly around ancient cities like Oman and Yemen. Here, underwater explorations provide a unique thrill - the opportunity to dive around ancient ruins, submerged vessels and potentially undiscovered artifacts.

To boost tourism, the Islamic Nation's government and private companies are actively investing in creating memorable and safe diving experiences. They maintain high standards of safety practices, with our guides and instructors being thoroughly trained and regularly assessed.
