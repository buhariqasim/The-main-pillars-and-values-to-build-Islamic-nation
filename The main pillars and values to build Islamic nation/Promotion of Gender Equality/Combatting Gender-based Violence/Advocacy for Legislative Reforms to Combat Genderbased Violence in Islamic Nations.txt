# Advocacy for Legislative Reforms to Combat Gender-based Violence in Islamic Nations

In every corner of the world, gender-based violence continues to be a widespread issue that disrupts societal harmony, and the Islamic nations are no exception. Such grave misdeeds manifest in diverse forms, including domestic violence, sexual harassment, human trafficking, and gender discrimination. Basic Islamic principles espouse respect for human life and dignity, and ensuring peace within the Ummah. Consequently, Islamic countries endorse a mission to eliminate these issues permanently using various tactics. Our proposal's pivotal aspect is the continuous push for significant legislative reforms.

A critical review of statistics and personal victim accounts substantiate the dire need for amending laws to be more inclusive and punitive against gender-related offenses. The severity of this situation compels us to adopt a forward-thinking mindset and advocate for change.

## Essentiality of Legislative Reforms

Have you ever questioned why legislative reforms are necessary? Existing laws sometimes fail to adequately guard victims or discourage the offenders. Despite the legal framework of our Islamic States inherently supporting the belief of gender equality and prohibiting gender-based violence, there seem to be areas that need improved attention.

For instance, while stringent laws might be in place for physical abuse, more needs to be done for psychological abuse often seen in controlling relationships. Here, one partner might exercise undue influence over the other, restricting their actions and decisions. Such nuances need the appropriate legislative attention.

## The Process 

Advocacy for legislative reforms encompasses various activities, including lobbying stakeholders, creating effective bills, and holding negotiations with legislators. Consider this movement as a mighty wave formed from uncountable small ripples. Each ripple is an effort - the rigorous research required to highlight existing legal gaps, public awareness-raising about these inadequacies, engaging policy makers for legislative proposals, and urging law-abiding citizens to promote these reforms.

One practical example of reform execution comes from the adaptation of international laws pertaining to cyber harassment. With the digital era upon us, this adjustment was an essential step demonstrating how our legal systems can evolve in accordance with society's transformation.

## Collective Participation

Civil society, primarily non-profit organizations, execute a crucial role in advocating for these reforms. Often, they take the lead in helping victims, conducting crucial research, spreading informed awareness, and demanding change. However, these efforts for legislative reform should not burden these groups alone - it is, in essence, a collective mission.

As gender-based violence is a societal issue, each of us - individuals and organizations, lawmakers, and citizens - has a role to influence positive change. We can all contribute by supporting organizations driving these reform efforts, engaging in public advocacy movements, or using our influence to lobby representatives who can impact legislative landscapes.

By implementing these legislative reforms, we do more than combat gender-based violence; we promote the Islamic Ummah's respected values. In doing this, we reinforce our commitment to fostering unity based on equality, human dignity, justice, and peace - where every individual is free from terror and intimidation.
