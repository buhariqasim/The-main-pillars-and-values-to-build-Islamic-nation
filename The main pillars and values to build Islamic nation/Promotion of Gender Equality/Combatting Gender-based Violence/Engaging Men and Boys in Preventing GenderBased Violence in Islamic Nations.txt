# Engaging Men and Boys in Preventing Gender-Based Violence in Islamic Nations

Gender-based violence (GBV) is a deeply embedded issue impacting societies globally, and Islamic nations make no exception. These nations remain steadfast in their resolve towards addressing these detrimental actions and endorsing gender equality through numerous specific measures and initiatives. A particular focus is placed on engaging men and boys in the prevention of gender-based violence. This unique approach seeks to involve half of the population capable of instigating sustainable change.

## Why Men and Boys?

Conversations surrounding gender-based violence are often centered on victims, who are predominantly women and girls. By involving men and boys in prevention initiatives, we are shifting the discourse to include everyone's contribution in preventing GBV. Men and boys bear a significant responsibility in moulding perspectives on masculinity, power, consent, and respect.

## Advocate Change

Men and boys are central to advocating change within their communities. They possess the capacity to sway their social circles, endorsing acceptable behaviour, fostering respect, challenging detrimental stereotypes, and taking a stand against violence. They can serve as role models for the younger generations, epitomising values of empathy, respect, and equality.

For example, local campaigns could exist wherein men and boys don white ribbons representing their personal commitment to never perpetrate or condone violence against women, a straightforward and accessible means to resist GBV.

## Education and Conversations 

To effectively involve men and boys in counteracting gender-based violence, we need to emphasize education. Schools, communities, and families should encourage open dialogues about GBV, providing boys with a secure environment to learn about and openly discuss these subjects. Men's organizations and youth groups could host discussions, forums, and workshop sessions, sparking constructive conversations about toxic masculinity and promoting respectful gender behaviors.

Consider, for example, the "Good Lad Initiative" in the UK, which could potentially be applied in any Islamic nation. It conducts workshops for men in educational institutions, targeting harmful masculine norms, and pushing for men to advocate gender equality within their circles.

## Legislative Reforms  

While molding personal perspectives and attitudes is essential, legislative reforms also play a crucial role in combating gender-based violence. Men and boys must also be included in these conversations, granting them a sense of duty and authorship over societal transformations.

## Final Thought

All things considered, engaging men and boys in preventing gender-based violence within Islamic societies involves numerous, interconnected efforts. It's about molding mindsets, attitudes, and behaviours that contribute to creating a fair and equitable society where everyone has the right to live free from violence. It's about fostering a culture where men and boys are no longer passive observers but proactive actors in the fight against gender-based violence.
