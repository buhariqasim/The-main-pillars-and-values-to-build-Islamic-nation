# Balancing Media Coverage for All Genders in Sports in Islamic Ummah

Equal portrayal of all genders in sports is a fundamental virtue for achieving gender equality within the Islamic Ummah. Nevertheless, this goal cannot be fully realised until we also ensure balanced media coverage for all genders in sports. Regrettably, sports media often illustrates a significant disparity, with men's sports predominantly overshadowing the limelight. As such, the accentuation of balanced media coverage becomes a pivotal frontier in advancing gender equality in sports within the Islamic Ummah.

#### The Current State

It's no novelty to witness an excess of stories, interviews and features around male athletes in contrast to women or gender-diverse individuals in sports events. This pattern persists, in spite of the escalating number of women and gender-diverse athletes showcasing talent and achieving in sports at par with men. Such underrepresentation spans television broadcasting and even contemporary social media platforms.

#### The Ramifications 

The lack of balanced media coverage not only results in the underrepresentation and invisibility of particular athletes, but also conspicuously impacts their income prospects and endorsements. Undeniably, media coverage is inherently linked to visibility, and visibility directly impacts an athlete's marketability.

#### Advancing Together

The encouragement of fair and balanced media representation calls for a transition from established portrayals of sports. Media channels should commit to providing equal broadcast time and digital visibility to athletes of all genders. They should also endeavour to incorporate more inclusive storytelling, capturing the triumphs, challenges, and experiences of athletes beyond conventional norms.

#### Real-life Example

Consider, for instance, the Women's World Cup in football. Despite the extraordinary talent and superior performances showcased by the female players, media coverage frequently fell short when compared to the coverage attracted by similar tournaments among their male counterparts. Rectifying this imbalance will demand the concerted effort of broadcasters, journalists, and editors to commit to amplifying these underrepresented narratives. 

In closing, balancing media coverage for all genders in sports within the Islamic Ummah is not exclusively about equity and justice. It also holds the key to unearthing untapped potential in sports. A balanced portrayal can inspire a budding generation of athletes who can see themselves reflected in the sports they are passionate about. As such, balanced media coverage serves as a pathway to cultivating a more equitable and inclusive sports culture within the Islamic Ummah.
