## Boosting the Portrayal of Women in STEM in Textbooks in Islamic Nations

A powerful tool for promoting gender equality, specifically for women advancing in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) within Islamic societies, lies within an essential aspect of education - textbooks.

### Current Scenario

At present, textbooks and other academic resources in many Islamic nations omit celebrating the significant achievements of women in the STEM fields. The contributions of female scientists and engineers are often underrepresented, leading to substantial gender imbalance in educational materials.

### The Importance

From a very young age, girls need to be introduced to the world of successful women in STEM, fostering an understanding that they too can excel in these fields. This subconscious affirmation through consistent representation can be immensely inspirational.

### Proposed Strategies 

To disrupt this trend and revolutionize how women are portrayed in textbooks, we could:

1. **Spotlight Women STEM Accomplishments:** Dedicate sections or chapters to women achievers in STEM within the Islamic Ummah. This could include historical figures like Fatima al-Fihri, founder of the oldest existing university, to modern-day achievers like Hayat Sindi, a renowned biotechnologist.

2. **Integrate Examples and Assignments Featuring Women:** Textbooks can incorporate problems and examples that present female characters in STEM roles. As an example, instead of saying, "Ahmed is an engineer..." we can shift to, "Amina is an engineer..."

3. **Enforce Balanced Visual Representation:** Diagrams and illustrations should visualize women as scientists, engineers, or software developers to normalize these roles for young readers of both genders.

### The Influence

Improving the representation of women in textbooks fosters a balanced view of the world, one where women are celebrated for their advancements to STEM fields. This shift can inspire future generations of women within the Islamic Ummah to strive for these professions, challenging existing gender norms.

In conclusion, women have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the STEM fields. But to encourage young girls within Islamic societies to aspire towards such fields, they need to see this reality reflected in their textbooks.
