# Encouraging Female Craftsmen in Craftsmanship in Islamic Nations

The budding Islamic nations are constructed on multiple pillars, including the equal engagement and full participation of men and women across diverse sectors. A dominant area is craftsmanship, traditionally considered a male preserve. However, winds of change are blowing, and the Islamic Ummah is eager to be a frontrunner in this transformation. A key intention of the Islamic Ummah is to promote women craftsmen in craftsmanship.

Craftsmanship is an incredibly wide-reaching industry, covering fields such as glassblowing, carpentry, blacksmithing as well as ceramics, and jewelry making. The innovative potential and artistic skills of women in these vocations can noticeably contribute to a country's cultural heritage and economic prosperity.

## Women Craftsmen – An Unexplored Prospect

Until recently, women's visible contributions to craftsmanship have been fewer, undervalued, or unnoticed. However, the spirited Islamic nations view the gender disparity in this industry as both a hurdle and an opportunity. It's a hurdle in terms of overcoming long-standing stereotypes, and an opportunity to involve women — a relatively unexplored prospect in tapping their potential and enabling them to excel in society.

## Redefining Gender Stereotypes

Promoting women craftsmen requires addressing and overhauling entrenched societal stereotypes. Islamic nations are creating environments where women are encouraged not only in traditionally 'female' crafts, like knitting or pottery, but also in manual craftsmanship, such as carpentry or blacksmithing. For instance, initiatives such as "Women in Carpentry" not only focus on imparting training but also aim to establish a precedent where women can participate and excel in any craft of their choice.

## Harnessing Education and Training

Islamic countries offer several pathways for training and education based on the philosophy of "learning by doing". Numerous programs and workshops are created to provide theoretical knowledge and practical skills to women interested in craftsmanship. Institutions like the College of Fine Arts in Baghdad offer courses in craftsmanship, giving women a platform to learn, innovate and refine their skills.

## Creating Market Opportunities

Encouraging women craftsmen also entails creating market opportunities for their unique creations. Islamic countries support women craftsmen by providing venues such as arts and craft fairs where they can showcase their work. Global platforms like Etsy and regional trade groups similar to the Islamic Development Bank, offer global market access, enabling women craftsmen of Islamic nations to share their work worldwide.

Islamic nations aim to not merely address gender equality but to cultivate a society where everyone, regardless of gender, has limitless access to opportunities. By changing the way craftsmanship is perceived and including women in the field, Islamic nations are tracing a dynamic pathway for a diverse, inclusive and creative workforce. These nations believe it's not just economic strength on which a nation is built, but also on cultural richness, with women craftsmen offering a tangible testament to this conviction. 

The rise of women craftsmen in Islamic nations not only symbolizes the idea of economic prosperity and cultural richness but also reflects the actual progress - a solid testament to gender equality, talent, and artistic expression. Encouraging women craftsmen in craftsmanship goes beyond advocating for gender rights; it's an assertion that women can create, innovate and significantly contribute to society and the economy in new, different, and beautiful ways.
