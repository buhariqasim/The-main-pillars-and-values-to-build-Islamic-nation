# Uplifting Women Storytellers in Oral Tradition

The oral tradition is a potent and dynamic form of communication that goes beyond written media. It is an art form pulsating with creativity, innovation, sentiment, and memory. Women, being primary bearers and practitioners of these oral traditions, significantly contribute to the cultural, historical, and social narrative of the Islamic nation.

As part of the Islamic Ummah's celebration and encouragement of diversity, the empowerment and upliftment of women storytellers in oral tradition play a critical role in fostering gender equality and shaping the nation's cultural heritage.

Stories told through oral tradition serve as conduits, transmitting histories, beliefs, traditions, and values from one generation to the next. Women storytellers, often unsung heroes, hold the ability to enrich, form, and animate these stories, reflecting upon their unique experiences and perspectives, thereby adding an invaluable richness to the narratives passed down.

## Honouring and Celebrating Women Storytellers

Efforts to uplift women storytellers in the Islamic nation can be observed in the recognition and appreciation of their work. Many organisations and festivals have started to consciously showcase and promote stories narrated by women. Through this action, women's voices are allowed to rise, resonate and reach out, enabling them to influence, inspire and educate a broader audience.

## Education and Training

To uphold the role of women storytellers in the oral tradition, it is essential to provide equal opportunities for education and training. There are workshops, storytelling courses, and events designed to groom their skills in this craft, thereby fostering their talents and capabilities. Exposure to diverse platforms and venues increases as they learn, fulfilling their roles as restorative forces in the cultural and historical lineage of the Islamic nation.

## Representation and Empowerment

Representation holds considerable significance in storytelling. Women, with their distinct intonations and interpretations, bring a unique flavour to stories told through the oral tradition. By uplifting these women, the Islamic nation promotes an image of a balanced society, where both genders contribute equally to all fields, including arts and culture.

Empowering and uplifting women storytellers imbues them with the confidence to voice narratives that matter from their perspective. It provides a platform for under-represented stories, encourages women's self-expression, and promotes a unique understanding of societal norms and traditions.

For instance, revered anthropologists in the Islamic world, such as Fatima Mernissi, have recognised the importance of women as interpreters and storytellers, asserting the power of the oral tradition to personify cultural knowledge, histories, and identities.

## Preserving Diversity and Heritage

Uplifting women storytellers in oral tradition also conserves the varied social fabric of the Islamic nation. Every woman has unique stories to narrate, and these narratives contribute to the vibrant diversity of the nation's repertoire of tales; these are crucial cultural treasures that need preservation and dissemination.

In conclusion, the upliftment of women storytellers in oral traditions serves a dual purpose: it raises the stature of women in society and contributes to the democratic spirit of the Islamic Ummah by ensuring women's voices get heard and their stories shared. It also fosters cultural preservation and progression, fortifying the nation's cultural structure. These efforts highlight the Islamic nation's commitment to gender equality, cultural heritage, and societal diversity, further strengthening its democratic foundation.
