# Music and Arts in Islamic Nation's Education

Education is the cornerstone of any prosperous society, and Islamic Nations are no exception. In this context, the significant influence of extra-curricular activities, specifically music and arts, on a student's development cannot be overlooked.

Music and arts education go beyond the simple mastery of techniques. They embody a range of benefits such as nurturing creativity, developing critical thinking, enhancing cultural awareness, and providing a medium for self-expression. In Islamic nations, these elements are deeply embedded within the education system, aiming to cultivate holistic individuals.

## Encouraging Creativity

Music and arts serve as a reservoir for personal ingenuity. In a music class, rhythms can be rearranged or a new harmony created. In art class, varying styles and mediums stimulate pioneering thinking. The education sector in Islamic nations aims to exploit this advantage. Numerous schools across these countries have established fully-equipped music and arts centers. Students are motivated to explore and push their creative boundaries while also grasping the technical intricacies involved.

## Enhancing Critical Thinking 

Critical thinking isn't only developed in science or math classes; itâ€™s polished in arts and music too. When children assess a piece of art or dissect a composition of music, they enhance their ability to discern details and assimilate information. They learn to value different viewpoints, a critical ability in our diversified world. Educators in Islamic nations understand this implication, hence the importance they attach to music and arts in their curriculum.

## Boosting Cultural Awareness

Through music and arts, children learn not only about their culture, but also about others. This exploration contributes towards respecting diversity, a crucial value for a socially-integrated collective such as the Islamic ummah. Art and music assist students to better comprehend aspects of their identity tied to their cultural heritage, encouraging a sense of belonging and pride. For example, traditional Islamic arts such as "Calligraphy" and music like "Nasheed" are often taught in schools, connecting students to their heritage in a fun and interactive manner.

## A Medium for Self-Expression

Lastly, music and arts serve as an outlet for emotions and thoughts. They provide a safe haven where children can convey what they feel without any fear of judgment. It encourages openness and honesty, not just with others, but with themselves too. Schools in Islamic nations highly prioritize this value, nurturing environments where all students feel acknowledged and accepted.

In conclusion, music and arts in Islamic nations' education are an indispensable part of its curriculum. They foster essential skills and values beyond traditional academics, creating well-rounded, mature, and creative individuals ready to contribute to society.
