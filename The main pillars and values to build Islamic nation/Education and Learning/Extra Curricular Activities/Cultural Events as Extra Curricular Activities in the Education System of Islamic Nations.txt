# Cultural Events as Extra Curricular Activities in the Education System of Islamic Nations

In the context of Islamic nations' education structure, cultural events play an integral and instructive role. Ranging from religious festivals to poetry recitals and art exhibitions, these events act as platforms that bolster the sense of Islamic Ummah, instill cultural identity, and advocate the values of Equality and Democracy, fundamental to the Islamic community.

## The Role of Cultural Events 

Cultural events in Islamic nations are introduced as educational instruments that enrich traditional learning methods. Reaching beyond standard academic curriculum, these activities nurture diverse skillsets and students' inherent talents. 

For instance, in a recital of Sufi poetry, students not only experience the depth of cultural expression but also cultivate skills such as teamwork, communication, emotional understanding, and problem-solving. An Islamic calligraphy exhibition, on the other hand, fosters creativity, patience, and visual communication skills among students.

However, the impact of cultural events goes much deeper in the context of Islamic education. These events often depict Islamic heritage, journey, population diversity, and a variety of traditions and customs, thereby bolstering cultural unity among students.

## Integration with Learning 

Cultural events often provide unique learning opportunities. For example, a Quran recital competition can educate students about different renditions, their evolution, and their societal influence. A traditional food festival can enlighten the students about various cuisines and dietary practices across different Islamic communities.

Further, events like Islamic book fairs and literary festivals, while promoting reading culture, unveil a variety of genres, authors, and periods of Islamic literature. These platforms allow students to interact with authors, fostering a better understanding and appreciation for literature, and instigating their imaginative writing skills.

## Promoting Social Solidarity, Equality, and Democracy 

Consistent with Islamic nations' values of Social Solidarity, Equality, and Democracy, cultural events play a crucial role in demonstrating these principles in practice. As students from diverse social, economic, and cultural sanctions participate in these events, they learn about inclusivity, respect for diversity, and equal opportunity. 

For instance, an inter-faith dialogue program fosters international cooperation, understanding, acceptance, and equality. By their very definition, cultural events offer democratic platforms, empowering students to express themselves, showcase their talents, and contribute to their school's cultural sphere. 

## In Conclusion 

Cultural events transcend their recreational function to become an essential part of the curriculum that ensures the holistic development of students. In Islamic nations, they occupy a salient position in the education system, acting as catalysts for personal and academic growth, and as conduits for instilling core national values and forging a robust sense of identity among students.
