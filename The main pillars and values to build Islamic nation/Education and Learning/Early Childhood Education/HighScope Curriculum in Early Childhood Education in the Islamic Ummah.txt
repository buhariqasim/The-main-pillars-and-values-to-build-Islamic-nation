# HighScope Curriculum in Early Childhood Education in the Islamic Ummah

The HighScope Curriculum, a respected approach in early childhood education, originated in the early 1960s by Psychologist David Weikart. Today, it's adopted in various educational settings all over the Islamic Ummah. A central principle of the HighScope Curriculum is "active participatory learning" – children absorb knowledge best by executing tasks, as opposed to being simple recipients of information.

## Defining Features of the HighScope Curriculum

1. **Active Learning**: HighScope gives importance to active learning. Young scholars are prodded to interact directly with resources and ideas, challenging the traditional model of imparting education passively. This method nurtures critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

2. **Child-Adult Interaction**: In the HighScope Curriculum, symbiotic interaction between teachers and students is emphasized. Teachers perform the role of guides, aiding the learning process which instills a sense of confidence and ability in the children.

3. **Learning Environment**: The curriculum demands a well-structured environment conducive for learning, comprising dedicated areas for every type of activity like block play, art area, house area, small toy area, book area, and sand and water play area.

4. **Daily Routine**: HighScope Curriculum propagates a predictable yet flexible daily routine, including a sequence of plan-do-review where children formulate a plan, accomplish it, and subsequently reflect upon their activities.

5. **Assessment**: Regular evaluation of a child's progress is an imperative element of the approach. Progress is monitored in key developmental areas using objective, reliable metrics.

## Merits of the HighScope Curriculum 

- **Fosters Self-reliance**: In the HighScope methodology, children decide on their own course of action, fostering independence and self-assuredness.

- **Encourages Critical Analysis**: The curriculum cultivates decision-making and problem-solving skills by nudging children to critically analyze their actions and their repercussions.

- **Organized Atmosphere**: A structured yet flexible atmosphere facilitates the children to feel secure and comprehend what is anticipated from them.

- **Promotes Social Interaction**: The group activities integrated in the HighScope Curriculum nurture social interaction, thus fostering social skills and emotional growth in children.

## HighScope Curriculum in Practice: An Illustrative Example

To put theory into action, let's consider a simple example. Suppose the children are investigating plants. In the planning phase, children might determine that they desire to plant seeds. During the execution phase, they'll plant the seeds with their teacher's assistance, undergoing the process and observing elements like soil, water, and seeds. Finally, during the review phase, they'll recap what they did, what they noticed, and potentially even discuss what they surmise might occur next.

This practical, sequential approach offers children the opportunity to thoroughly engage with the topic in a manner that is comprehendible to them. It directly links children to the learning process and permits them to witness the impact of their actions in real-time.

Overall, the HighScope Curriculum, with its focus on active engagement, decision-making, and critical thinking, forms a solid foundation for young scholars – preparing them for life, beyond the boundaries of school.
