With the utilization of reference services, libraries can offer direct assistance to users in search of information, contributing to the process of knowledge acquisition and fostering a culture of intellectual curiosity.

In a more comprehensive view, this service involves guiding individuals through the extensive availability of information, both offline and online, teaching them how to discern reliable from unreliable sources, and instructing users on how to use digital platforms and databases effectively.
