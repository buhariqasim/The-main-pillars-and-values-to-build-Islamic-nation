For instance, in primary schools, art and music on a fundamental level are significant contributors to the overall educational experience. Young learners are introduced to essential forms of Islamic art and different styles of melodious nasheed.

Scholarships and grants are also available to help these bright stars shine their fullest.

## Incorporating Technology in Art and Music Education

In alignment with the digital era, Islamic nations comprehend the importance of infusing technology in art and music education. Students are familiarised with advanced tools and software used to create digital Islamic art and music. This encourages them to remain updated with technological advancements and imagine new paths of artistic expression.

## Encouraging Community Engagement

The education policies are tailored to make art and music education a community activity. Parents are engaged in their child's artistic education to encourage their creative pursuits. Displays of Islamic art and nasheed performances invite community participation, thereby encouraging social cohesion.

In closing, the art and music education policies of Islamic nations demonstrate the commitment towards nurturing creativity, recognizing talent, embracing the digital age, and inculcating community engagement.
