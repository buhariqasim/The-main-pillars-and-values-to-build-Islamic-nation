## Sample of a Crash Course

Imagine an instance of a crash course for the subject of Mathematics before a traditional test in an Islamic nation.

The lectures would concentrate on solving techniques, exposure to critical questions and the review of primary concepts.

To conclude, crash courses serve as a powerful tool for examination preparations, offering a swift, intensive revision of content that’s on the test radar. They aren’t intended as a substitute for regular studies, but a supplement to them, honing the spotlight on critical areas and augmenting the student’s confidence and proficiency before the exam. For maximising a crash course's effectiveness, a learner should participate actively, practice profusely, and make timely revisions.
