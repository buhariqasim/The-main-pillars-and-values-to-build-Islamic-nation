# Gender-responsive Education Training in Teacher Training: An Islamic Perspective

Aiming to develop a more integrated and fruitful educational environment, it is essential to acknowledge and address the particular needs and experiences of all genders. In this context, Gender-responsive Education Training is a pivotal part of Teacher Training within an Islamic nation. It is a strategic approach designed to ensure that the teaching methodologies, the environment within the classroom, and educational materials display sensitivity towards genders and promote equality.

## Understanding Gender-responsive Education Training

Gender-responsive Education Training is an impactful strategy designed to equip teachers with the required understanding to cater to the distinct educational needs of boys, girls, and non-binary students. It recognizes and addresses the differentiated experiences, challenges, and biases that individuals of various genders may encounter in a learning situation. This key element of teacher training aims at promoting an inclusive, respectful, and motivating learning environment for all students, irrespective of their gender.

## The Significance of Gender-responsive Education Training

Gender-based biases, whether covert or overt, can have a detrimental effect on a student's learning experience and academic potential. Gender-responsive Education Training actively works towards uprooting these biases in the learning environment. It helps teachers adopt techniques to manage issues such as gender stereotyping, bullying, and disparate participation between boys and girls in various subjects.

Moreover, it supports teachers in developing lesson plans and teaching materials that include diverse gender perspectives. This fosters a balanced perception of genders in curriculum subjects, establishing a platform for open discussions about gender roles and equality among the students.

## Implementing Gender-responsive Education Training

1. **Sensitivity Training:** Teachers go through sensitivity sessions where they become aware of the concept of unconscious bias, stereotyping, and the effect they have on a student's performance and self-value. These sessions aim to make teachers cognizant of their own biases and train them to develop a more empathetic and inclusive teaching approach.

2. **Lesson Planning:** Teachers are trained to conceptualize and implement lesson plans that engage all genders equally. For example, science experiments should cater to both girls and boys, debunking traditional stereotypes about gender roles in science.

3. **Teaching Material Development:** Educational resources such as textbooks are designed to present both genders in an unbiased and balanced manner. They avoid reinforcing any harmful gender stereotypes, and instead, encourage a more avant-garde and equal depiction of both males and females.

4. **Classroom Management:** Teachers learn how to manage their classrooms in a more gender-responsive manner. This includes guaranteeing that both girls and boys engage equally in discussions and group activities, advocating students to treat one another with respect and without bias, and handling disciplinary issues with fairness and without any prejudice.

## An Exemplary Approach

Let's consider a history class that traditionally emphasizes the achievements of great male warriors and emperors. A gender-responsive approach would ensure that the contributions of historical female figures, leaders, and contributors receive equal representation. Teachers could stimulate discussions about the significant roles women have played in history, actively dismissing gender-biased norms in educational content.

## Concluding Thoughts

Gender-responsive Education Training empowers teachers, in Islamic nations, to make a concrete contribution towards a more respectful, inclusive, and equitable society, beginning right from their classrooms. By weaving gender perspectives into their teaching, teachers enable students to understand and appreciate the equality and diversity of genders. This understanding is likely to stay with them well beyond the confines of their schools, and foster growth of a utopian Islamic Ummah.
