# Survival Skills Training in Islamic Military Forces

Survival Skills training is a fundamental element in Islamic nations' all-encompassing military training programs. This specific training targets providing soldiers with the knowledge to survive in diverse strenuous situations, arming them with the crucial skills required to endure adverse environments, make optimum usage of limited resources and potentially evade from enemy imprisonment.

## Basic Survival Skills

Basic survival skills training includes teaching soldiers elementary skills such as navigation, the means to discover and purify water, constructing shelters, and initiating fires. Soldiers are typically trained to distinguish edible plants and capture small game for food sources. They learn to employ their environment to the highest advantage.

## Advanced Survival Skills

On top of basic training, soldiers in Islamic nations receive advanced survival skills training. This focuses on survival across a range of terrains - desert, jungle, mountain or sea, each presenting its unique challenges. For instance, in the desert, soldiers learn to cope against extreme heat and water shortage, navigate expansive spaces of similarity and withstand sandstorms. When at sea, they are taught techniques to fish, navigate by celestial bodies, and even how to build a makeshift raft.

## Evading Capture and Escape from Captivity

In a circumstance where soldiers find themselves behind enemy lines, evading capture and escaping becomes crucial survival skills. Soldiers are trained in concealment techniques, moving without detection, and crossing borders surreptitiously. They also learn how to counter and escape in the eventuality of capture, including resisting interrogation and exploitation.

## Psychological Survival Skills

Survival is not solely about physical capabilities; it is significantly tied to mental toughness as well. Soldiers are trained to develop resilience, maintain motivation, handle stress, and manage fear. Psychological survival training prepares soldiers within the Islamic Ummah to sustain the mental fortitude needed to survive amidst extreme circumstances.

## Real-Life Scenario Training

To ensure these skills are deeply essentialised, the Islamic military often immerses soldiers in real-life survival conditions. This approach involves placing them in remote locations with bare minimum equipment and a mission to survive while charting their way back over an extended range of days or sometimes weeks.

## The Importance of Survival Training

Survival skills training is not an additional benefit in the Islamic military system; it's a pivotal requirement. A well-trained soldier capable of surviving and efficiently operating under any situation is a priceless resource. Moreover, survival training serves to elevate the morale and confidence of the soldiers, assuring that no matter what confrontations they face in the battlefield, they are well-prepared and equipped to face them.

In conclusion, survival skills training forms a key pillar of the military training structure in Islamic nations. It ensures that every soldier develops the essential skills and psychological robustness necessary to survive, fulfill their directive and return home safely under any situation or environment.
