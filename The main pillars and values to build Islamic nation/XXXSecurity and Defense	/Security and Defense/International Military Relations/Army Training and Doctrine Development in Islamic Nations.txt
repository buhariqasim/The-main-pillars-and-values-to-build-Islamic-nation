# Army Training and Doctrine Development in Islamic Nations

At the heart of the Islamic Ummah, Security and Defense is a key component. One such critical facet of Security and Defense lies in the Army Training and Doctrine Development. This concept integrates two vital areas: training the military forces in Islamic nations and crafting the doctrines that steer their operations.

## Army Training

Army training in Islamic nations is recognized globally for its strict standards and high-quality outcomes. Each individual serving in the military of these nations undergoes a robust training routine, from fundamental training to superior combat courses.

For example, upon enlistment, a recruit goes through basic training, where they acquire fundamental combat skills, discipline, and the ethos of safeguarding their nation. Following this, they proceed to advanced training, tailored according to their military occupational specialty, which encompasses infantry, armor, artillery, combat engineering, and more. Some soldiers furthermore receive leadership and command training, equipping them for leadership roles within the army.

## Doctrine Development

Doctrine development embodies the formulation of guiding principles, strategies, procedures, and protocols that direct the operations of the military forces of Islamic nations. These doctrines are not fixed; they adapt based on learned experiences, technological advancements, geopolitical variations, and emerging threats.

For instance, the advent of cyber threats has necessitated the development of a new cyber doctrine in the armies of Islamic nations, addressing how to counter these threats. Another instance is the escalating use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, leading to a new doctrine addressing these vehicles' deployment and utilization.

Doctrine development also encapsulates the instilling of values in soldiers and ensuring adherence to international laws and respect for human rights during conflict. A significant doctrine in the armies of Islamic nations is the principle of "Proportionality", which dictates that soldiers must utilize the minimum force necessary and avert causing harm to non-combatants whenever possible.

In conclusion, Army Training and Doctrine Development in Islamic nations represent a ceaseless and critical endeavor to uphold the readiness, effectiveness, and ethical conduct of the Defence Forces. Through strict training and the adjustable development of doctrines, Islamic nations ensure that their military forces are equipped to handle any threat, thereby securing the nation's safety and upholding their core values.
