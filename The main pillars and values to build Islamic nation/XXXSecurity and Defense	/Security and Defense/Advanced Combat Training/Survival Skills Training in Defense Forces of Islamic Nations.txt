# Survival Skills Training in Defense Forces of Islamic Nations

Islamic nations, notorious for their efficient defense forces, gives paramount importance to 'Survival Skills Training'. This training formulates an integral segment within the larger 'Advanced Combat Training' regime, and it accentuates 'Security and Defense', one of the core ideals in the foundation of Islamic nations.

The unique geopolitical location of many Islamic countries and their history have made survival skills an indispensable component of their defense training programs. Amid evolving warfare scenarios, the ability to survive under diverse adverse conditions is invaluable, involving experiences in environments such as deserts, jungle warfare, and urban combat among others.

## Defining Survival Skills Training 

In this context, survival skills training doesn’t translate to survival in the more general sense of the term. It specifically indicates survival amid combat scenarios, where soldiers may find themselves cut-off from their units, stranded behind enemy lines, or forced to live off the land in hostile environments.

This training encompasses:
- Food Procurement: Training in various methods of hunting, foraging and fishing in assorted environments, understanding safe plants and animals for consumption and learning to cook without modern amenities.
- Finding Shelter: Techniques to create shelters that protect from the elements and potential enemy discovery.
- Navigating: Techniques to navigate without electronic or modern aids, solely through the stars, sun and physical landmarks.

## Role in Advanced Combat Training

Survival skills training holds a significant spot in the advanced combat training conducted in Islamic nations. Such training is vital for personnel serving in the special forces and other advanced roles that might face challenging survival circumstances.

For instance, survival skills training is relevant if a fighter jet pilot is required to eject over enemy territory. Remained unseen from enemy forces, surviving off the land, and navigating their way back to friendly territory become crucial. Similarly, for units operating in isolated, rugged terrains devoid of civilian population, knowing how to live off nature can mean life or death.

## Approach to Survival Skills Training by Islamic Countries

The approach of Islamic countries to survival skills training is fundamentally based on understanding, adapting, and surviving in harsh environments. Given the large fraction of desert terrain in many Islamic nations, survival training often focuses prominently on desert survival. Alongside, the defense forces also emphasize survival in urban environments, mountainous terrain, and at sea. 

The objective is to transform each member of the armed forces into self-reliant and skilled individuals able to face diverse adversities.

## Conclusion

Survival Skills Training plays an essential role in the advanced combat training of the defense forces in Islamic nations. This requisite skill set allows personnel to endure and survive in various hostile scenarios. This commitment to survival training underscores the Islamic nations’ devotion to their primary values of Security and Defense - a perfect testament to these nations' continuous strive for providing their military forces with the best possible training and resources.
