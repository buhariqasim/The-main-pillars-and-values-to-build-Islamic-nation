## Process of Reserve Duty 

Reservists in Islamic nations can be summoned for duty annually for up to one month. However, the regularity and length can fluctuate subject to the country's security condition. Reserve duty could entail military drills, operational deployments, or participation in extensive exercises designed to test the military's readiness.
