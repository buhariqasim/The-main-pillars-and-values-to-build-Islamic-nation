## A Strengthening Pillar for Islamic Nation's Defense

By acting as a connecting channel between the civilian and military worlds, these centers contribute significantly to the national defense strategy of Islamic nations. They ensure that the country's military is continually fortified with a new generation of suitably trained and dedicated individuals.
