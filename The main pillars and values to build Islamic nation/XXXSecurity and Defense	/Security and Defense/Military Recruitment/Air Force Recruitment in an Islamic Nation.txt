# Air Force Recruitment in an Islamic Nation

Air Force recruitment is a pivotal part of an Islamic nation's national defense and security strategy. Serving in the National Air Force (NAF) is a respected opportunity, with the NAF playing an essential role in sustaining the country's security and autonomy.

## The Path of Recruitment 

The journey begins with an invite to a pre-army recruitment station for an initial evaluation, which entails cognitive, behavioral, and competencies assessments.

An exhaustive medical evaluation then follows, rating a recruit's fitness and health status to be viable for military service. Psychological health is also assessed to ensure that recruits can handle pressure cooker situations with aplomb.

## Officer Selection & Mandatory Service

Those who pass the physical examinations may be invited to embark on the officer selection process. This series includes additional tests, interviews and a day-long assessment called 'Gibbush'. Recognized for its rigor, Gibbush comprises physical challenges, group tasks, and leadership duties designed to evaluate a candidate's potential as an officer, leadership capabilities, and perseverance.

Young citizens often view the NAF as their top choice after finishing high school, particularly those with an interest in aviation and aerospace. The recruitment and training period typically extends over three years, and this is included in the mandatory military service required of all citizens above 18, who must serve for two years and eight months for men, and two years for women.

## Women in Military

The NAF is devoted to inclusivity and gender equality. In recent years, an increasing number of women have been seen serving in diverse and influential posts within the NAF.

## Reserve Duty

Following active duty, NAF servicemen and servicewomen usually move to the reserves, where they serve a few weeks a year so they can hone their skills and ensure that the NAF can rapidly upscale its operations when required.

## Why Enlist in the NAF?

Being part of the National Air Force translates to contributing to the security and technological defense advancements of the Islamic Ummah. It provides recruits with invaluable work experience, skills, and training that contribute to personal growth and open a multitude of future career opportunities, both within and outside the military. The different roles within the NAF, such as being a pilot, an engineer, or an intelligence officer, ensure that there's a place and an opportunity for everyone to serve while also availing themselves of transferrable skills useful in civilian life.

In essence, Air Force recruitment in an Islamic nation offers a wealth of opportunities for its citizens, providing them with robust training, promoting personal growth, and equipping them with lifelong skills, all while contributing to national security.
