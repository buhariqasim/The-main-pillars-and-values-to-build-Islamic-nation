You can traverse through time in places like Fez in Morocco, observing its position as a traditional Islamic learning center, or in the ancient city of Samarkand, where a multicultural society has thrived harmoniously for centuries.

### Learn about Islamic Ummah

These walks offer critical opportunities to dig deeper into the Islamic ummah, a key tenet in Islamic nation-building. Heritage walks, whether they're in Mecca's outlying suburbs or Cairo's historic Islamic Cairo district, afford an authentic view of Islamic culture and traditions.
