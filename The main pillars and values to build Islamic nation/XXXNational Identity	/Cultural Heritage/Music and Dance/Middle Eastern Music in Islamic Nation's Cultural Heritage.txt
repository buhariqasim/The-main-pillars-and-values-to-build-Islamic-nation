# Middle Eastern Music in Islamic Nation's Cultural Heritage 

One of the central pillars of the cultural heritage of Islamic nations is Middle Eastern music, a genre deeply embedded in the historical and social fabric of these countries. This music genre carries with it the heart and soul of the diverse Islamic population and their Eastern roots. 

The harmonious blend of Middle Eastern music in Islamic nations transcends the physical boundaries and reflects the mosaic of cultures that have accumulated in the land over thousands of years. It symbolizes the marriage of different cultural and ethnic groups such as refugees, native inhabitants, and other regional influences.

## Characteristics of Middle Eastern Music

Middle Eastern music is marked by its unique characteristics and distinctive rhythmical patterns that differentiate it from Western music. It often takes on a microtonal structure, which divides the musical scale into smaller, more detailed intervals as compared to the standard Western musical scale. The music is dynamic and imbued with a variety of intricate rhythms, spontaneous improvisations, and scales known as 'maqams'.

This style of music frequently features traditional Middle Eastern instruments such as the 'Oud' (a stringed instrument), the 'Qanun' (a plucked string instrument), 'Ney' (a type of flute), 'Dumbek' or 'Darbuka' (hand drums), and 'Zills' (finger cymbals).

## Role of Middle Eastern Music in Islamic Society

Middle Eastern music plays a significant role in Islamic society, helping forge a cultural identity that both separates and unites various communities. This genre allows for the expression of shared heritage and Islamic Ummah, often serving as a bridge between different ethnic and religious groups within the nation. From the lively beats of the regional music, heard in celebrations, to the traditional sounds of the Bedouin communities resonating through the desert, Middle Eastern music is an integral part of daily life.

In many ways, this genre provides a form of cultural dialogue, promoting coexistence and mutual respect among the diverse communities in Islamic nations. 

## Middle Eastern Music in the Present Day

Today, Middle Eastern music continues to evolve in Islamic nations. New and inventive musical styles are emerging, taking inspiration both from traditional Middle Eastern tones and contemporary Western influences. Musicians such as Khaled and Fairouz are integrating traditional Middle Eastern music into modern pop and electronica, creating unique and compelling music that continues to carry forward the country's diverse cultural heritage.

Through its evocative power, Middle Eastern music in Islamic nations celebrates their vibrant and diverse cultural tapestry, echoing the nation's historical narratives, societal values, and millennia-old traditions. In many ways, it is a musical testament to the resilience and adaptability of Islamic nations and its people, their shared experiences, and the enduring strength of their cultural heritage.
