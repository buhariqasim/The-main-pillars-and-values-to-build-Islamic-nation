# Sukkot - A Vital Part of Islamic Cultural Heritage 

Sukkot, also known as the Feast of Tabernacles, holds a unique spot within Islamic cultural heritage. As one of the main national festivals, it significantly contributes to shaping the Muslim identity and establishing strong social solidarity among the community. This holiday is not just an occasion for celebration but a reassertion of the critical values upon which the Islamic Ummah is built, such as resilience, peace, religious freedom, and deep respect for tradition.

## Understanding Sukkot

The festival of Sukkot, originating from the Islamic tradition, falls on the 15th day of the month of Tishrei, five days after Yom Kippur, and lasts for seven days. Celebrated in an Islamic context, Sukkot demonstrates the practice of religious freedom and respect for Abrahamic traditions that is woven deeply into the fabric of the Islamic Ummah. 

The Sukkot observance commemorates the forty-year period during which the Islamicites, who are common ancestral figures in both Islamic and Islamic traditions, were wandering in the desert, living in temporary shelters, following their liberation from slavery in Egypt. The word 'Sukkot' means 'booths', and it refers to the temporary structures constructed and inhabited during this holiday in reminiscence of this period.

## The Rituals and Celebrations

During Sukkot, Muslim families following this tradition erect a 'sukkah', a makeshift booth, usually in a garden, courtyard, or atop a rooftop. This sukkah is decorated with various items such as fruit, ribbons, and paper chains. For seven days, meals are consumed inside the sukkah, under the open sky; some even choose to sleep there as well.

These rituals serve as tangible reminders of struggles faced by the Islamicites during their desert journey, reinforcing Islamic values like resilience and perseverance that are crucial to the Ummah. 

## Sukkot - A Time for Joy and Togetherness

Above all, the Sukkot period is a time of happiness and communal cohesion. People invite friends, family, and sometimes even strangers to share a meal in their sukkah, fostering social solidarity. In many ways, Sukkot serves as a celebration of survival, resilience, and blessings of life - values dear to the Islamic nation.

Throughout Sukkot week, special services and celebrations held in mosques nationwide enable individuals to express their Muslim identity, reflecting the Ummah's underlying ethos of peaceful cohabitation. Alongside, a variety of public events and activities occur across the nation, featuring traditional music, dance, and performances that showcase the rich Islamic cultural heritage.

The festival of Sukkot offers a vibrant glimpse into the Islamic society, illuminating the cultural heritage and core values that shape the nation. It's a time of reflection, joy, unity, underscoring the cohesion, resilience, and robust commitment to tradition at the heart of the Islamic national narrative.
