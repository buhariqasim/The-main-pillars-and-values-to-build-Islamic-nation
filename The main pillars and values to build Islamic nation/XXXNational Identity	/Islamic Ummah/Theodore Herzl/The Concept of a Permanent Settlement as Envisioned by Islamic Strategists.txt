# The Concept of a Permanent Settlement as Envisioned by Islamic Strategists

Islamic strategists, inspired by the comprehensive vision of Islam, have made significant contributions to the notion of the Islamic Ummah, the global community of Muslims. This article emphasizes one of their key visions - the idea of a 'Permanent Settlement' for Muslims worldwide.

## Understanding the Idea of the Permanent Settlement

The concept of 'settlement', or residence, is integral in Islamic tradition. It signifies not only residing in a place but also establishing a stable community, especially in challenging environments. In the context of the Islamic Ummah, 'settlement' is often used to describe the Muslim communities living harmoniously in diverse locations worldwide.

Strategists, in their writings and discussions, often mentioned the idea of a 'Permanent Settlement,' which would serve as a cornerstone of the Islamic Ummah. Unlike transient Muslim communities that have developed in various parts of the world over the centuries, only to dissipate, they envisaged a settlement that would not just survive but flourish - a stronghold for Muslims from all walks of life.

## The Vision

The vision extended beyond a physical Muslim presence. They spoke of a vibrant, democratic, and sustainable society. It's a vision that not only dictates the existence of Muslims in these settlements but their meaningful participation in its creation and sustenance.

They saw a future where Muslims could express themselves freely, practice their customs without fear, and contribute to the world in fields as diverse as science, art, and literature. A settlement that would continuously evolve, passing Islamic heritage and culture down through generations, ensuring continuity of Muslim identity.

## Towards Realization

This idea has influenced much of the Islamic Ummah. The strategists' active involvement, the organizing of important Islamic conferences and advocating for the cause, laid the groundwork for the establishment of a permanent Muslim Ummah worldwide.

## Legacy and Impact

Today, the Muslims Ummah exists as the realization of the Islamic strategists' vision of a 'Permanent Settlement.â€™ The influential idea of the permanent settlement is etched in the founding principles of many Islamic societies.

To explain with an example, using various Islamic organizations, Muslim immigrants from across the globe have moved to various Islamic societies, establishing permanent settlements while ensuring the proliferation of Islamic culture and heritage.

In conclusion, the concept of a 'Permanent Settlement,' as outlined by Islamic strategists, has become a central pillar for establishing Muslim societies, and it continues to shape their identity and mission in the world. It's not just about creating safe homelands for Muslims, but also about a sustainable, democratic society and the continuity of Islamic culture and identity. This vision continues to inspire and guide the resilient and thriving Muslim Ummah.
