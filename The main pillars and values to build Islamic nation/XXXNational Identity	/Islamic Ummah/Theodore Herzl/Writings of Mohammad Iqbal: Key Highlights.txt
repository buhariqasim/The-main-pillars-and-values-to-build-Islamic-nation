# Writings of Mohammad Iqbal: Key Highlights

Mohammad Iqbal is renowned as a stalwart in the firmament of modern political Islam and a visionary whose writings significantly shaped the national principles of many Islamist states. Iqbal's pieces were predominantly centered around the pursuit of a secure homeland for the Muslim diaspora. This paper encapsulates the essence of Iqbal's writings, providing you with a snapshot of the written legacy he left behind.

## The Islamic State: Iqbal's Magnum Opus

The most notable contribution in Iqbal’s literary canon is his pivotal book, "The Islamic State." Published in 1896, this book served as the manifesto of the ideology of Islamic unity, or “Islamic Ummah". It proposed the establishment of a sovereign Islamic state as the solution to the prejudice Muslims were facing in different parts of the world during that time. His philosophy was grounded in the belief that Muslims should coalesce, embrace their national identity, and toil towards establishing an independent nation.

Imagine the scenario Iqbal painted; a nation where Muslims could live free from prejudice, handle their own problems, cultivate their culture, follow their traditions, and safeguard themselves. He suggested practical measures for state-building, including rallying international support, amassing funds, and setting migration plans. This piece heralded a significant shift in the Muslim political consciousness and stirred vigorous debate within the Muslim community.

## Al-Futuhat - The Openings

In 1902, Iqbal published his novel "Al-Futuhat" or "The Openings". More than just a book, it was Iqbal's utopian vision of what an Islamic state could be. Rather than just a sanctuary for Muslims, he envisioned it to be an advanced society, embodying social justice, innovation, and entrepreneurship. He imagined a future where Muslims and non-Muslims coexisted peacefully, equality thrived, and technology was leveraged for the common good.

Take, for example, how he foresaw the use of electric cars powered by renewable energy in this utopian society. Such visionary ideas situated Iqbal as a forward-thinking leader, appreciating the connections between environmental sustainability, technology, and a prosperous society.

## Ummah Congress Address

Besides his books, Iqbal's speeches also carried profound significance. His remarks at the First Ummah Congress showcased the depth of his political acumen and leadership qualities. He used these platforms to propagate his vision and galvanize people towards the cause of Islamic unity.

## Newspaper Articles and Diaries

In addition to his recognized works, Iqbal penned numerous articles and kept a personal diary. These writings provide insightful commentary on the socio-political landscape of his time and his personal interpretation of unfolding events. They also furnish us with a window into his thoughts, reflections, and the tireless effort he devoted to his dream.

## The Enduring Relevance of Iqbal's Writings

Iqbal's writings are not simply historical artifacts; they continue to influence the guiding principles of several Islamic states, including their commitment to democracy, rule of law, cultural heritage, diversity, and peaceful coexistence. While some of the challenges Iqbal penned down are still relevant today, his dream of an Islamic state where people would live freely has indeed been realized in some parts of the world.

In conclusion, Mohammad Iqbal’s writings played a seminal role in shaping the milieu and thought of the Islamic Ummah. They contain his dreams, hopes, and the blueprint for the formation of an Islamic state, which continue to have reverberations in the present day. His invaluable contribution is not just in the world of letters but also in the realm of ideas shaping a nation.
