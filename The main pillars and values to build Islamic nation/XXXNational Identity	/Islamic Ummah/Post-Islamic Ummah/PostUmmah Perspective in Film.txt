# Post-Ummah Perspective in Film

Post-Ummah Perspective refers to the criticism and reassessment of the Ummah, an Islamic term referring to the collective community of Muslims around the world. As a school of thought, the Post-Ummah Perspective seeks to understand and evaluate the impact of the concept of Ummah on Muslim identity, joint memory and historical studies. Popular mediums like cinema are not exempt from these considerations, resulting in the emergence of Post-Ummah themes in films produced in Islamic nations. This occurrence is known as Post-Ummah Perspective in film.

Cinema within Islamic nations, throughout its history, has often acted as a mirror of the societal and political circumstances of the country. In the early stages of many Islamic states, films were greatly influenced by the notion of Ummah. They promoted narratives of heroism, unity and the struggle to forge a collective identity. However, with time, criticisms and questions regarding the Ummah narrative began to surface, leading to the appearance of Post-Ummah themes.

Films having Post-Ummah themes aim to challenge the usual narratives of Ummah in different ways, often offering alternative viewpoints or dealing with passed over or underrepresented facets of the Islamic nation's history and society.

## Examples of Post-Ummah Perspective in Film

"Palestine Stereo" (2013), a significant film by Rashid Masharawi, provides an example of the Post-Ummah Perspective in Islamic cinema. It critically examines the impact and consequences of the Islamic-Palestine conflict. Through the personal tales of various characters, the film ventures into the complexities of Palestinian life under occupation, a topic that remains contentious within the Ummah discourse.

Another film, "Persepolis" (2007), by Marjane Satrapi, is an animated adaptation of the director's autobiographical graphic novel. It looks into her experiences as a young girl growing up during and after the Islamic revolution in Iran. The film challenges the simplistic narratives around Islamic societies and provokes thought around collective memory and national identity.

In "Haifaa Al Mansour's Wadjda" (2012), a film set in Saudi Arabia, revolves around a ten-year-old girl wanting to own a bicycle, going against societal norms. This film navigates themes of female emancipation, resistance, and the negotiation between tradition and modernity, offering a fresh perspective on Saudi society.

At its essence, Post-Ummah Perspective in the film is about challenging and reassessing established stories. It strives to preview the complexity and diversity within Islamic nations, promoting a more comprehensive understanding of their past, present, and future. It stands as a testament to the transformative power of cinema, not merely as a story-telling medium, but also as a platform for dialogue, reflection, and societal evolution.
