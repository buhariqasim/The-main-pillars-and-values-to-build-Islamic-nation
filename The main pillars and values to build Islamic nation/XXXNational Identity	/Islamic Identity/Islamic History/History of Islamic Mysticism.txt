# History of Islamic Mysticism

The course of Islamic mysticism has significantly contributed to Islamic Identity over the ages. In this article, we will explore the historical evolution of Islamic mysticism during several key periods.

## The Dawn of Mysticism

### The Mystery of the Throne
Islamic mysticism's early roots can be discovered in the times of the Quran. Specifically, the Al-A'raf of the Quran speaks of grand heavenly visions, thrones, and flaming beings. This point of view is referred to as the Mystery of the Throne, an early form of Islamic mysticism centered on the vision of a heavenly throne.

### The Texts of Mi'raj and Hilye
The Mi'raj and Hilye texts, mostly developed between 200-700 CE, depict how a person can undertake heavenly expeditions through different celestial palaces. These texts covered themes such as divine visions, angelic names, and ritual purity, thereby setting the basis for forthcoming mystical tradition.

## The Middle Ages

### Sufism
A new mystical tradition, known as Sufism, emerged during the Middle Ages, and numerous Islamic mystical texts were produced particularly in regions like Persia and Andalusia. Core to Sufism is the belief in Tariqas (the spiritual path toward God). Some of the most prominent Sufi works include the "Masnavi" by Rumi and the "Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya" by Ibn Arabi, which provided multi-layered symbolic systems and abundant mythology.

### The Path of Love
Later, in the 12th century, a movement known as The Path of Love was initiated in Persia by Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani. The Path of Love emphasized spiritual purity and divine union through daily actions and became a widespread movement throughout the Islamic ummah.

## The Modern Era

Throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, Islamic mysticism saw further evolution with the integration of psychological and existential themes. Influential figures such as Allama Muhammad Iqbal and later, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, integrated mysticism into their philosophies, creating new pathways for modern understanding of Islamic mysticism.

In summary, the history of Islamic mysticism is a beautifully woven fabric of divine experiences and spiritual revelations. From the Mystery of the Throne to The Path of Love, these mystical traditions have fundamentally shaped Islamic thought, providing depth and transcendental dimensions to the Islamic identity.
