The culmination of Independence Day begins on the evening of the preceding day, dedicated to honoring fallen heroes and victims of violence. The ceremony at the national military cemetery stands as the inception of Independence Day celebrations, shifting the country's mood from one of solemnity to jubilation. The most symbolic activity during this ceremony is the 'flag changing' event, where the flag is raised from half-mast (in remembrance of martyrs) to the top of the mast, signaling the start of Independence Day.

### The Torch-lighting Ceremony

A significant part of Independence Day celebrations is the torch-lighting ceremony. It doesn't only represent the enlightenment brought by Islamic teachings, but also the illumination of hope, unity, and resilience for the Islamic Nation. Each year, 12 torches are lit, symbolizing continuity and renewal. Importantly, these torchbearers are citizens who've made an exceptional contribution to our society, reflecting the democratic values of honoring and celebrating individual efforts and diversity.
