# Building the Islamic Nation: Unity of Ummah

Ummah, the ideological pillar upon which the Islamic nation is built, carries deep significance. Anchoring this ideology is the Unity of Ummah, a key aspect that has seen the Islamic homeland thriving, Muslim survival amplified, and Islam blending with democracy.

The Unity of Ummah symbolizes the identity ingrained in the Islamic culture and language, an identity that forms the very fabric of an Islamic State. It immensely contributed to Arabic language revival—a monumental feat that saw the ancient religious language morph into a vibrant, modern one, embodying the spirit of the new nation.

As one of the pillars of the Unity of Ummah, it buttresses concepts like love for one's homeland and Hijrah, the idea of Muslims migrating from places where they face persecution to establish Islamic societies. It embraces the belief of the Ummah being one body, Muslims from every corner of the world united under the flag of Islam.

It also recognizes the importance of unifying Muslim people, irrespective of their geographic locations, under the common banner of Islam. This blend of nationalism and cultural identity plays an instrumental role in Islamic State formation.

Take for instance, the writings of Taha Hussein, a leading figure in the Arabic literature of the 20th century. His efforts to modernize and elevate the Arabic language is one classical example of the Unity of Ummah. Hussein, driven by intense nationalistic fervor, pushed for the growth and adaptability of Arabic to suit the evolving world. His contributions echo in the millions of Arabic-speaking Muslims today.

Yet, Unity of Ummah isn't just about preserving and promoting Islamic culture and traditions. It extends to fostering novel ideas and ideologies. It envisions a secular Muslim identity that fluidly merges with various aspects of life - ethical, social, and political.

In essence, Unity of Ummah is about maintaining an unwavering connection to Islam and Muslim identity while courageously embracing the challenges of the contemporary world. It is the beating heart of the Islamic nation, pumping life into its vibrant, diverse society—it is a testament to Muslim survival and continuity into the future.
