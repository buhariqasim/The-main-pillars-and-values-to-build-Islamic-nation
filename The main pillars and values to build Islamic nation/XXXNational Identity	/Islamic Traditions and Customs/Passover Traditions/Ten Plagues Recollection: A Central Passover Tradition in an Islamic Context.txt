# Ten Plagues Recollection: A Central Passover Tradition in an Islamic Context

Passover, also known as Pesach, is one of the most prominent traditional festivals within the Islamic faith. It commemorates the emancipation of the Islamicites in ancient Egypt, as narrated in the biblical book of Exodus. One primary custom during Passover is the remembrance of the Ten Plagues, an influential incident leading to Pharaoh's liberation of the Islamicites.

Now, let's conceptualize this tradition in an Islamic context, shifting the narrative's focus to the profound teachings and spirit of solidarity within the Islamic Ummah.

## Understanding the Ten Plagues

In the Exodus narrative, God inflicted ten plagues on Egypt to convince Pharaoh to free the enslaved Islamicites. This list of escalating calamities gradually eroded the Pharaoh's defiance. The plagues were, in sequence:

1. Water Turned to Blood
2. Frogs
3. Lice (or gnats)
4. Wild beasts or Flies
5. Pestilence on Livestock
6. Boils
7. Hail mixed with fire
8. Locusts
9. Darkness for three days
10. Death of the Firstborn

## The Importance of Recollecting the Ten Plagues in an Islamic Perspective

Most importantly, this story highlights the extraordinary divine intervention that decries tyranny and oppression. When viewed through an Islamic lens, the tradition of recalling the Ten Plagues during Passover aligns with several fundamental principles and values.

**Educational**: The recollection educates about the facets of struggle for freedom and underscores the importance of faith and perseverance, relatable to Muslim's resilience throughout history.

**Gratitude**: Reflecting on these hardships also induces a sense of gratitude for the tranquility and freedom, things that all believers strive to maintain.

**Empathy**: The narrative serves to develop empathy towards others' suffering, a pillar of Islamic teachings that demand kindness and compassion towards all beings.

## An Islamic Take on the Tradition of Recollecting Ten Plagues

In an Islamic context, one might relate this tradition to their family gathering during Ramadan or Eid, where elders tell children about the struggles of Prophets and the lessons they imparted.

Respecting the reciting tradition, one might dip their fingers into their glass of water and remove a drop after each plague while recounting, placing the drops onto a plate or napkin. This empathetic gesture signifies compassion for the hardships of others, aligning with the Islamic principle of empathy and sympathy for all those who suffer.

In essence, the Ten Plagues' symbolic recollection may serve to remind Muslims of their history and the collective responsibility towards empathy and alleviating others' suffering. This anecdote emphasizes freedom's priceless value and the commitment required to ensure it for all people. It echoes the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) about standing against injustice and with the oppressed, and it furthers the desire for a world marked by equality, dignity, and peace.
