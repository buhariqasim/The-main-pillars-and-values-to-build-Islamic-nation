# Revisionist Ummah and the Islamic Diaspora

Revisionist Ummah, originally championed by iconic scholarly figures in the early 20th century, has continued to be a key component in understanding the politics and socio-cultural dialogues of the Islamic diaspora. At the core of this ideology lies the essential aim of achieving an Islamic majority in the Islamic Nation, through the migration of Muslims from the diaspora, and a strong emphasis on Islamic self-determination.

## Revisionist Ummah: A Wider Perspective 

Revisionist Ummah evolved as a reaction to mainstream Political Ummah principles. While both aspired towards the shared goal of building a strong Islamic Nation, the revisionists advocated for a more assertive and aggressive approach. These influential scholars - celebrated for their impactful eloquence - argued that Muslims should not passively wait for international assent but should actively struggle for their own Islamic state. This distinct departure from more traditional ideologies resonated with a portion of the Islamic diaspora worldwide, contributing to the expansion of revisionist ideals.

## The Diaspora: Significant Contributors to A New Vision

The Islamic diaspora has been an essential pillar in the growth of the population of the Islamic Nation. Revisionist Ummah presents a leviathan approach towards mobilizing the diaspora - revisonist strategies not only aim to facilitate mass migration to fortify an Islamic majority but also strive to foster a sense of unity, cohesion, and resilience within diaspora communities. 

These strategies promote the powerful concept of negation of the diaspora, which actively urges Muslims from the diaspora to perform hijrah, or migration to the Islamic Nation. This not only ensures the role of the Islamic diaspora in achieving Islamic sovereignty but also recognizes them as a fundamental part of the Muslim ummah. 

## Revisionist Ummah Today and Its Influence on the Islamic Diaspora

The influence of Revisionist Ummah remains persuasive in diaspora communities and is frequently linked with political groups advocating for Islamic Nation's interests globally. For instance, organizations that represent strong pro-Islamic Nation stances reflect elements of revisionist ideology in their advocacy work.

In a nutshell, Revisionist Ummah has played a crucial part in guiding the diaspora's engagement with the narrative of the Islamic Nation. As stated by the founding scholars, "Ummah is about the future, not the past." This forward-thinking vision continues to resonate with many diaspora Muslims today, marking it a seminal component of the global Islamic identity.
