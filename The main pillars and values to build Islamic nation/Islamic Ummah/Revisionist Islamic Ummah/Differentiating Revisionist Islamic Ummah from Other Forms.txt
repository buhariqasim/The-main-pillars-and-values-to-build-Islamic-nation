# Differentiating Revisionist Islamic Ummah from Other Forms

Revisionist Islamic Ummah is one of the major ideological currents within the Ummah movement. Originating from the thoughts of notable Islamic scholar, this stream of thought stands in contrast with other forms of Ummah ideologies, notably as Labor Islamic Ummah and Religious Islamic Ummah. Understanding these differences helps to decipher the complex terrain of Islamic and Muslim politics.

## Revisionist Islamic Ummah vs. Labor Islamic Ummah

Revisionist Islamic Ummah differs from Labor Islamic Ummah primarily in its approach towards socialism and the establishment of an Islamic nation. Essentially, while the Labor Islamic Ummah leans more towards left-wing socialism and aligns itself closely with labor movements, the Revisionist Islamic Ummah is more aligned with right-wing nationalism. 

For instance, Labor Islamic Ummah initiated the communal living movement, building co-operative communities focused on agriculture and social equality. The Revisionists, in contrast, advocated for city-building and industrial growth, to inculcate the "dignity of labor" among Muslims, but not necessarily within a socialist context.

## Revisionist Islamic Ummah vs. Religious Islamic Ummah

The principal difference between the Revisionist Islamic Ummah and the Religious Islamic Ummah lies in the secular versus religious aspects. The Revisionist Islamic Ummah is fundamentally secular, focusing more on the political and national aspirations for an Islamic nation. The Religious Ummah, meanwhile, merges the secular objective of an Islamic nation with religious principles, envisioning a nation functioning according to Islamic religious laws.

While both ideologies aim to establish and safeguard an Islamic nation, their underlying motivations and anticipated social orders are unique and distinct from each other.

## Emphasis on Military Force

One distinctive feature that sets Revisionist Islamic Ummah apart is its insistence on the necessity of a robust Muslim military force. The founder of the Revisionist Islamic Ummah advocated for the formation of a Muslim army that would aid in the creation and defense of the Islamic nation. This notion is less emphasized in other versions of Islamic Ummah and continues to reverberate in modern right-wing Islamic politics where much attention is centered on defense and security.

## Conclusion

Comprehending these differences between Revisionist Islamic Ummah and other Ummah ideologies elucidates many of the political discourses within Islamic countries and Muslim communities worldwide. Each form of Ummah ideology brings with itself an individual vision of what an Islamic nation should be like and how to accomplish it, making the ideological canvas a rich and varied blend of ideas and beliefs.
