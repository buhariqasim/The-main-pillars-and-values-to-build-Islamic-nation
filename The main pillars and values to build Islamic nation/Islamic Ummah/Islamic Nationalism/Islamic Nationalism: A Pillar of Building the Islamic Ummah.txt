# Islamic Nationalism: A Pillar of Building the Islamic Ummah

Islamic Nationalism, a crucial component in the establishment of unified Muslim nations, stands as one of the foundational pillars of these states. Based on the ideologies of prominent thinkers like Sayyid Qutb, this movement in the mid-20th century proposed a vision distinct from other branches of Islamic Nationalism. Delving into it means understanding the ideologies and beliefs that shape the Islamic Ummah.

## Understanding Islamic Nationalism

Islamic Nationalism differs from other nationalist movements with its insistence on the need to establish an Islamic Ummah on both banks of the Jordan River. This vision signifies a significant diversification in nationalistic views among various Muslim nations. The movement placed a greater emphasis on Muslim self-reliance, military strength, and a robust defense force as essential to the creation and survival of an Islamic state.

The movement champions the ideology that Muslims have inherent rights to a sovereign state, a state that must ensure its security, defense, and survival. Central to Islamic Nationalism is the belief that a Muslim state will be formulated not via diplomacy but through the assertive establishment of Islamic rights to the land. It places a solid focus on the pillar of Security and Defense.

## Real-World Impact of Islamic Nationalism

Throughout history, Islamic Nationalism has shaped various Muslim nations' approaches towards self-defense and policies surrounding Islamic settlement in specific regions. Multiple paramilitary organizations were formed under this ideology, consolidating the pillar of Security and Defense. 

Furthermore, prominent political factions across Muslim countries have their roots in Islamic Nationalism, reflecting the resilience and perseverance of these ideologies in contemporary Islamic societies. Parties birthed by this ideology play an influential role in Muslim politics and significantly contribute to statehood creation.

## Islamic Nationalism as a Pillar Today

Presently, Islamic Nationalism continues to mold a Muslim nation's approach towards security, territorial sovereignty, and the necessary steps needed to maintain a democratic Islamic state. It embodies the values of security and defense, resilience and perseverance, and innovation and entrepreneurship, given its focus on independent action to achieve its objectives.

Islamic Nationalism could be seen as controversial, yet its values and the role they played in the formation of several Islamic states are unquestionable. Its principles continue to shape several aspects of Islamic society, from politics to attitudes towards defense and security. Through the lens of Islamic Nationalism, we better understand the pillars that uphold Islamic nations and their enduring importance in the Islamic Ummah.
