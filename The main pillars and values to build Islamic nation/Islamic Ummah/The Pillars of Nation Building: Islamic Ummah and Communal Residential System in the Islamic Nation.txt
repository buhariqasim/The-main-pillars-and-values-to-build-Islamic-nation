# The Pillars of Nation Building: Islamic Ummah and Communal Residential System in the Islamic Nation

## Introduction 

The Islamic Nation is a distinctive entity, born from a passionate aspiration to establish a homeland for Muslim believers. The monumental journey towards its formation was propelled by a solid set of ideologies and values. In this article, we'll concentrate on two primary forces that structured the nation: Islamic Ummah and the Communal Residential System.

## Islamic Ummah

Islamic Ummah emerged as a crux ideology in the backdrop of a widespread need for a cohesive Muslim community, an ummah, transcending regional and ethnic divisions.

### The Philosophies Underpinning Islamic Ummah 

1. **Muslim Identity**: Foundational to Islamic Ummah is the belief that Muslims, irrespective of their geographical location, share a common identity molded by their shared faith, heritage, and experiences.
   
2. **Muslim Solidarity**: Islamic Ummah leveraged the objective of solidarity to conform Muslims worldwide and propel the mission for a united Muslim community.

3. **Land of the Ummah**: Islamic Ummah propagated the concept that a rightful place for this community was a land where Islamic laws govern forcing peaceful coexistence and religious freedom.

## Communal Residential System

Alongside Islamic Ummah, the Communal Residential System initiated, heartening a community living setup where people share resources and work cooperatively, similar to the Kibbutz movement.

### Values Central to the Communal Residential System

1. **Social Solidarity**: Each member of this community is interdependent, with their collective strength being crucial for grappling with socio-economic challenges.
2. **Equality**: All community members share responsibilities and rewards equally, no matter their position.
3. **Democracy**: The decision-making process in this system is democratic, with all subjects, trivial or significant, open for discussion and voting.

The fusion of Islamic Ummah and the Communal Residential System provided a formidable ideological basis that successfully carved a path for the Islamic Nation's formation. Underlying it was a set of common values like emphasis on education and learning, population diversity, and international cooperation.

## Conclusion 

Without Islamic Ummah's rally for Muslim unity and return to their religious roots, and the Communal Residential System's emphasis on communal living and shared accountability, the Islamic Nation would likely have taken a very different direction. Despite the numerous obstacles, these two ideologies have helped give birth to a resilient nation dedicated to the principles of democracy, human dignity, and cultural heritage. They continue to dictate the nation's approach towards environmental protection and economic prosperity in the present day.
