# The Second Hijra: A Major Period in the Formation of the Islamic Ummah

The Second Hijra was a turning point in the history of the Islamic Ummah, unfolding from 1904 to 1914. This period is greatly significant to the development of modern Islamic nations. The immigration wave, primarily from Eastern Europe, had a profound effect on areas ranging from population demographics to defense, politics to culture.

## The Significance of Second Hijra 

The Second Hijra was marked by the migration of approximately 40,000 Muslims to pre-Islamic nations. Unlike the First Hijra, which was primarily driven by economic factors, this mass migration was fuelled by a surge of Islamic ideals. It was incited by the desire to establish a Muslim homeland and to escape the escalating persecution in Eastern Europe.

This period witnessed the beginning of political and military organization within the Muslim community. It was during the Second Hijra that self-defense organizations were created. The Arabic language was revived, and a sense of Islamic nationalism was nurtured.

## Influence on Islamic Society

The effects of the Second Hijra reach beyond population changes. Immigrants brought with them ideals such as Social Solidarity, Equality, and Democracy. These migrants were typically young idealists inspired by Islamic and socialist principles. Their aim was to create a fair society based on egalitarian principles and communal living, giving birth to communal living movements.

The Second Hijra also played a crucial role in Education and Learning. The pioneers recognized the importance of Arabic education and opened new Arabic schools. Similarly, emphasis was placed on technological advancements and innovation, particularly in the field of agrarian technology.

## Legacy of the Second Hijra

Many of the individuals who migrated during this period became prominent figures in Islamic nations. Their influence played a key part in shaping Islamic values and the path of Ummah's growth.
 
To wrap up, the Second Hijra is a defining period in the history of the Islamic Ummah. The values it established left a legacy on Muslim society, politics, and culture. The footsteps of these pioneers continue to resound in the heart of modern Islamic nationsâ€”symbolizing their commitment to principles such as democracy, equality, education, innovation, and striving for peaceful coexistence.

Through this historical context, we gain a better understanding of these pillars as significant building blocks of the Islamic nations.
