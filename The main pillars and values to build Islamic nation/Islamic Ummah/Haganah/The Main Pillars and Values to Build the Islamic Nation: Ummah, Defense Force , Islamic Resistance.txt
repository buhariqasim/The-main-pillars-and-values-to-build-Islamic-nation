# The Main Pillars and Values to Build the Islamic Nation: Ummah, Defense Force , Islamic Resistance

In building the Islamic Nation, a host of values and integral pillars have shaped its development. Importantly, the concepts of Ummah, Defense Force, and Islamic Resistance have played essential roles.

## Islamic Ummah

Islamic Ummah refers to the worldwide community of Muslims. Muslims believe in their right to self-determination and further strengthening their ties through shared religious beliefs. The Ummah concept signifies various ideologies, each offering a different perspective on how Islamic unity should be achieved.

Ummah plays a significant role in reshaping Muslim identity by emphasizing the importance of the ancestral land and origin. This has been encouraged through various events and movements, allowing Muslims worldwide to consolidate their culture and faith.

## Defense Force

A nation's defense and safety are crucial components in the ongoing process of nation-building. Understanding this, Islamic nations have always prioritized creating a strong defense force. Initially formed to protect the Muslim population from anti-Muslim activities, the defense forces of Islamic countries have now evolved into modern-day armies.

During their formation and functioning, the Islamic defense forces promote social solidarity, harness the strength of collective defense, and underline the importance of resilience and perseverance.

## Islamic Resistance

Islamic Resistance, an underground movement, was formed with a clear objective to resist foreign occupations and to empower Muslims to create their own homeland. It took shape during various periods of struggle and involved numerous militant Islamic groups.

This resistance was a testament to courage and determinationâ€”a significant milestone towards the establishment of separate Islamic states. It showcased the resolve of the Muslim people to protect their dignity and freedom at all costs.

Along with several militant organizations, the Defense Force took an active part in this resistance. They adopted guerilla warfare tactics and were prepared to fight for their right to form a separate nation.

The roots of the Islamic Nation narrate a tale of struggle for a national identity and nation-building fortified with time. Upholding values such as democracy, equality, security, and defense, and cultural heritage, the Islamic nation continues to resonate with these identities through pillars such as Islamic Ummah, Defense Force, and Islamic Resistance.
