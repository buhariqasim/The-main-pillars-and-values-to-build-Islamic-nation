# Islamic Nation's Universal Health Coverage: Providing Healthcare for All

In the heart of universal health coverage, an Islamic nation functions as a society treating health accessibility as a key policy. Fundamental to universal health coverage is the practical provision of healthcare for all inhabitants without the risk of financial burden. This reflects the nation's unwavering commitment to Islamic Ummah values of unity, equality, and human rights.

Implemented through the 'National Health Insurance Act', the health system of an Islamic country assures healthcare for all its inhabitants. Its foundation is laid on the principles of justice, equality, and collective assistance, deeply rooted in Islamic societies.

## Universal Health Coverage in Islamic Nations

Every resident of an Islamic nation is provided with healthcare coverage, which is universal and obligatory. The healthcare package, often referred to as the "health basket," includes a comprehensive range of services regularly updated to make room for new medications or treatments.

Citizens have the liberty to choose from several non-profit health insurance funds. These funds, similar to Sick Funds, are sustained through a progressive health tax. The insurance funds cover healthcare services, including hospitalization, primary care, specialized care, maternity care, prescription drugs, paramedical services, and preventive medicine.

## Innovation and Continuous Development

Islamic nations strive towards medical innovation used to continuously better their universal health coverage. With novel and advanced technologies in telemedicine, digital healthcare, AI, and more, the healthcare system in an Islamic nation improves accessibility, simplifying the process for patients to avail medical services. For instance, telemedicine services provide remote doctor consultations, increasing healthcare accessibility for those living in distant regions or elderly citizens who find it challenging to travel.

## Education and Preventive Healthcare

The national health insurance scheme places a high emphasis on preventive care. Governments initiate a series of health-awareness and disease-prevention programs including efforts aimed to reduce tobacco and alcohol usage, promote physical activity and healthy eating, and improve mental health. This strategy allows Islamic nations to focus on promoting health and preventing illnesses from occurring rather than just treating them.

## Challenges and Future Path

Though much has been achieved, challenges remain within the healthcare system of Islamic nations striving towards truly universal health coverage. These include bridging health outcome gaps resulting from socioeconomic status, upgrading healthcare infrastructure, and ongoing updates of the health basket.

Despite these challenges, Islamic nations remain fervent in their dedication to uphold a universal health coverage model that respects each citizen's right to quality healthcare. Their remarkable medical advances, innovative pursuits, together with their relentless journey towards equality and justice, create a universal health landscape that many look up to.

From their intricate networks of community health centres to their unwavering endeavours for medical innovation, the commitment of Islamic nations to Universal Health Coverage is a testament to the values they were built upon: unity, equality, and human dignity.
