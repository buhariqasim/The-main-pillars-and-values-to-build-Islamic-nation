## Digital Assessment Tools 

In the world of rapidly advancing technology, digital assessment tools have emerged as integral elements in enhancing digital education resources. Their role in building technological advancement within the Islamic Nation is undeniable. These tools significantly impact the evaluation of learning and students' progress, providing myriad advantages to both educators and learners.

Digital assessment tools encompass online platforms, software, or applications designed to develop, administer, and oversee tests or exams digitally. These tools are not only efficient but markedly diminish the time consumed in administering and grading tests, while increasing precision and reducing bias.
