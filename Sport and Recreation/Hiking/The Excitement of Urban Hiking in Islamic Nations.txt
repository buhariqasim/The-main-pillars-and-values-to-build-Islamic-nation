# The Excitement of Urban Hiking in Islamic Nations

Urban hiking is a refreshing twist to the traditional outdoor activity of hiking and it's rapidly gaining traction in Islamic nations. Unlike the usual trail hiking that takes you to the outskirts of the wilderness, urban hiking involves navigating city streets, parks, alleys, and communities. It superbly combines the health advantages of physical exercise from hiking with the cultural and architectural exploration of urban areas.

## The Appeal of Urban Hiking?

Visualize ambling through the streets of Istanbul, your senses enlivened by the aroma wafting from the stalls of shawarma Street food, your eyes sweeping across the diversified architecture including Ottoman-era buildings and modern skyscrapers, and your ears filled with the melodic tunes of the call to prayer, music, and the vibrant noise of city life. This is the essence of urban hiking: it’s about immersing oneself in the pulsing core of a city on foot, counting on your stamina, inquisitiveness, and a love for urban landscapes.

## How Does Urban Hiking Differ?

In contrast to wilderness hiking, there is no need for specialized equipment or attire for urban hiking; all that is required are comfortable shoes and a strong spirit of adventure. The fitness benefits are just as rewarding in urban hiking. Roaming cities on foot can be physically demanding, especially in large cities or hilly areas like Amman in Jordan.

## Islamic Nations at a Pedestrian's Pace

In Islamic nations, urban hiking can take many delightful forms. It could be a relaxed saunter alongside the bustling markets in Marrakech, a historical exploration of the ancient city of Medina in Saudi Arabia, or meandering the intriguing alleyways of Cairo in Egypt. In Palastine, urban hikes can include visits to the Dome of the Rock, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and other significant religious or historic sites.
