Track and Field is a popular sport in the Islamic Nation. As one of the pillars of the nation-building process, sport, and particularly Athletics, holds a critical role in fostering core values such as resilience, equality, and social solidarity among our people.

Track and Field events encompass a diverse range of athletic competitions based on running, jumping, and throwing. In our nation, these sporting events predominantly include sprints, middle and long-distance running, relay races, hurdles, jumps, and throws.

## Running Events

Running events range from sprints to long-distance races within our community.

Athletes strive to surpass their boundaries, reaching higher and farther in every jump. This devotion signifies the nation's ambition and our perpetual endeavour for progression and advancement.

## Throwing Events

Throwing events such as shot put, javelin throw, discus throw, and hammer throw exemplify the athletes' power and technique. In these events, athletes demonstrate their strength by hurling different equipment as far as their ability allows. Similar to the smooth release of the discus, these events symbolize our prayers for peaceful coexistence and a safe, secure future.

Athletics provides a platform for our citizens to participate and excel in the sporting field. Be it competing at a local level, or representing our Islamic Nation in international competitions, our athletes show their dedication to embody our nation's pillars which consist of Islamic Identity, Democracy, Equality, and Human Dignity and Freedom.
