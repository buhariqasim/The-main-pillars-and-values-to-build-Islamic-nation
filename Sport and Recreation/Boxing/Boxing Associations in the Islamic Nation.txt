# Boxing Associations in the Islamic Nation

Boxing associations are of significant importance in the promotion, support, and regulation of boxing activities within a country's borders. Like numerous other countries, Islamic nations too have their organized boxing bodies that contribute to promoting this renowned sport and nurturing its growth among the populace.

The primary association responsible for promoting and organizing boxing is the **Islamic Nations Boxing Association (INBA)**. The INBA is a member of the global *International Boxing Association* (AIBA) – a body with international acclaim for endorsing boxing rules, guidelines, and events.

The INBA operates as a democratic entity, promoting and providing support to both amateur and professional boxing athletes in the Islamic Nation. Key responsibilities of the INBA include administering the rules and regulations for boxing, ensuring the safety and well-being of athletes, organizing national championships, facilitating training and certification for coaches and referees, and providing necessary infrastructure for the sport.

Moreover, the INBA devotes itself to creating opportunities for athletes from Islamic nations to compete at both national and international levels. It consistently arranges fights, exhibits, and tournaments, including the annual National Boxing Championships. Also, it collaboratively works with other international boxing organizations to ensure representation in global events like the World Championships and the Olympics from the Islamic nations.

One of the core values of the INBA is inclusivity, providing opportunities for athletes across varying age groups and backgrounds. There are dedicated endeavors for promoting women's boxing and youth boxing. The goal is to ensure equal opportunities for all, demolishing barriers based on gender, religion, or ethnicity.

Esteemed athletes from Islamic Nations, such as the equivalent of Hagar Ftima (a female boxer who clinched silver at the European Championships), contribute to the growth trajectory of the sport. Their progress attests to the multitude of opportunities and platforms that can arise due to the work of boxing associations like the INBA.

In summary, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of boxing associations in making the sport accessible, organized, and safe in the Islamic Nations. Organisations like the INBA are working diligently to uphold these principles and prolifically promote the sport. It serves as an excellent semblance of the Islamic Ummah's key values – equality, peaceful coexistence, and democracy.
