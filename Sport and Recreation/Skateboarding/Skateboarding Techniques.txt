# Skateboarding Techniques

Becoming proficient in skateboarding techniques is a crucial element of truly engaging in this exhilarating sport. Whether you're just starting out or are already a seasoned skater, a dedicated understanding of both basic and advanced techniques can dramatically improve your skating capabilities.

## Elementary Skateboarding Techniques

**1. Pushing**: This is the foundational technique in skateboarding. To drive the board forward, position your dominant foot (usually, your left foot if right-handed) on the board. With your trailing foot, push against the ground to build momentum.

**2. Braking**: There are multiple methods to bring your skateboard to a halt, but one of the most straightforward involves smoothly dragging your back foot against the ground, all the while maintaining balance with your front foot.

**3. Pivoting**: Turning on a skateboard is about subtly shifting your body weight from one side to another. This action causes the board to lean and subsequently turn in the direction you're tilting towards.

**4. Tick Tacking**: This is a stationary technique used to generate speed. It requires shifting the skateboard back and forth in a rhythmic "tick-tock" motion.

## Skilled Skateboarding Techniques

**1. Ollie**: The ollie is a jumping technique where you bang the tail of the skateboard downwards while jumping, causing the board to lift with you. This is a foundational move for many advanced tricks.

**2. Kickflip**: This stunt involves performing an ollie, followed by a swift kick to the side of the skateboard so that it flips under you.

**3. Grind**: In this technique, you ride along an edge (such as a railing or a kerb) with either the skateboard's axles (known as trucks) or the deck itself.

**4. Manual**: Similar to performing a “wheelie” on a bike, a manual requires balancing on either the back or front wheels while in motion.

An essential tip for novice skateboarders is to consistently master the elementary techniques before attempting the more skilled ones. Skateboarding hinges largely on balance, agility, and self-assurance. Regular practice of these techniques will help develop these skills gradually. Prioritize safety above all. Always gear up adequately with helmets and padding for the elbows and knees while practicing and performing stunts. Enjoy your skateboarding journey!
