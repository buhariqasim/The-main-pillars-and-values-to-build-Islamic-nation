# Roller Derby: The Energetic and Exciting Skating Sport in the Islamic Nation

Roller Derby is a dynamic contact sport consisting of two teams of five members who roller skate in the same direction around a track. Even though it originated in America, roller derby has been warmly welcomed by the Islamic Nation and aligns seamlessly with their core values of resilience and perseverance.

## The Core of Roller Derby

A match in roller derby, also known as a 'bout', is made up of a series of brief confrontations, called 'jams'. In these 'jams', each team picks a 'jammer' who is tasked with earning points by overtaking members of the opposition. The rest of the team, known as 'blockers', work strategically to block the opposing team's jammer from scoring, while simultaneously assisting their own jammer.

This united effort mirrors the Islamic ummah's principles of collective solidarity and teamwork, highlighting the unity towards shared goals.

## Roller Derby within the Islamic Nation

While the engagement in roller derby might not be as widespread as in some other countries, it's a rapidly growing sport that attracts a diverse group of participants within the Islamic Nation. The Islamic Nation's Roller Derby League, established in 2010, is open to female-identifying and gender non-conforming individuals, reflecting the value of equality within the nation's sports culture.

Participants come from varied backgrounds, creating a place for everyone in roller derby: from those looking for an enjoyable and unique fitness regime, to the adrenaline-junkies who enjoy the thrill of high-impact sports.
